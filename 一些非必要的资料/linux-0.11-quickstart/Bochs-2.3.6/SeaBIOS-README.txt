SeaBIOS is an open source implementation of a 16bit X86 BIOS. SeaBIOS
can run in an emulator or it can run natively on X86 hardware with the
use of coreboot (http://www.coreboot.org/).

SeaBIOS is the default BIOS for qemu (http://www.qemu.org/) and
kvm (http://www.linux-kvm.org/).

The coreboot SeaBIOS (http://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS) page has
information on using SeaBIOS in coreboot. Please see the
releases page for information on recent releases. See the
download page to obtain SeaBIOS.

SeaVGABIOS is a sub-project of SeaBIOS.

Please join the mailing list to contribute to SeaBIOS. Information on
the internals of SeaBIOS is available on the Developer Documentation page.
