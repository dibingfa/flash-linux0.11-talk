<chapter id="introduction"><title>Introduction to Bochs</title>
<section id="whatisbochs"><title>What is Bochs?</title>
<para>
Bochs is a program that simulates a complete Intel x86 computer.  
It includes emulation of the Intel x86 CPU, common I/O devices,
and a custom BIOS. Bochs can be compiled to emulate many different
x86 CPUs, from early 386 to the most recent x86-64 Intel and AMD
processors which may even not reached the market yet.

Bochs interprets every instruction from power-up to reboot, and has
device models for all of the standard PC peripherals: keyboard, mouse,
VGA card/monitor, disks, timer chips, network card, etc.  Because Bochs
simulates the whole PC environment, the software running in the simulation
"believes" it is running on a real machine.  This approach allows Bochs
to run a wide variety of software with no modification, include most popular
x86 operating systems: Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP and Vista, all Linux flavors,
all BSD flavors, and more.
</para>

<para>
Bochs is written in the C++ programming language, and is designed to run
on many different host platforms<footnote>
<para>
Since Bochs can run on one kind of machine and simulate another machine, we
have to be clear in our terminology to avoid confusion.  The host platform is
the machine that runs the Bochs software.  The guest platform is the operating
system and applications that Bochs is simulating.
</para>
</footnote>, including x86, PPC, Alpha, Sun, and MIPS.  No matter what the
host platform is, Bochs still simulates x86 hardware.  In other words, it
does not depend on the native instructions of the host machine at all.
This is both a strength and a weakness, and it's the major difference between
Bochs and many other x86 emulation software such as VirtualBox, VMware, etc.
Because Bochs uses software simulation for every single x86 instruction, it
can simulate a Windows application on an Alpha or Sun workstation.  However,
the downside of Bochs' approach is simulation performance.  To model the
processor accurately, Bochs must run many instructions for every simulated x86
instruction, and this makes the simulated machine many times slower than
the physical machine.  Commercial PC emulators (VMware, Connectix, etc.) can
achieve much high emulation speed using a technique called
virtualization<footnote>
<para>
Virtualization takes advantage of simulating x86 instructions on an
x86 machine, allowing large portions of the simulation to take place
at native hardware speed.  Whenever the simulated machine talks to the
hardware or enters certain privileged modes (such as in kernel code),
the simulator typically takes control and simulates that code in
software at much slower speed, just like Bochs does.
</para>
</footnote>, but they are neither portable to non-x86 platforms nor open
source.
</para>

<para>
To do anything interesting in the simulated machine, Bochs needs to interact
with the operating system on the host platform (the host OS).  When you press a
key in the Bochs display window, a key event goes into the device model for the
keyboard.  When the simulated machine needs to read from the simulated hard
disk, Bochs reads from a disk image file on the host machine.  When the
simulated machine sends a network packet to the local network, Bochs uses the
host platform's network card to send the packet out into the real world.  These
interactions between Bochs and the host operating system can be complicated,
and in some cases they are host platform specific.  Sending a network packet in
FreeBSD requires different code than sending the packet in Windows XP, for
example.  For this reason, certain features are supported on some host
platforms and not others. On GNU/Linux, Bochs can simulate a network card that
communicates with the world, but on MacOSX the simulated network card may not
work because the communication code between the device model and the MacOSX
operating system has not been written.
</para>

<para>
<!-- really more like Background or Bochs History, but maybe it doesn't need its own section unless it gets to 3 paras or so  -->

Bochs was written by Kevin Lawton starting in 1994. It started as a program with a
commercial license, at the price of 25 USD, for use as-is. If a user needed to link
it to other software, that user would have to negotiate a special license.
&NEEDHELP; <footnote>
<para>
We need a Bochs historian to help out here.  For background, it would be
interesting to know how much Bochs sources used to cost and what it was used for.
I thought I saw an interview out there somewhere where Kevin says why he started
it and some more background information.
</para>
</footnote> Finally, in March 2000, MandrakeSoft (now called
<ulink url="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</ulink>) bought Bochs
and made it open source under the GNU LGPL.

<!--
we should make it clear that Kevin is not the primary maintainer of Bochs,
but I want to get some more background.  Did he get hired by Mandrakesoft
to do plex86 at the same time as Bochs was bought?  In his linux.com interview
Kevin said: "The only way I can move Bochs to open source is if someone
sponsors that happening. That would be ideal, and would enable me to focus more
on Bochs and FreeMWare, rather than be sidetracked with related consulting
jobs."

The last version of Bochs that he released was 3/25/2000, three days after the
Mandrake press release.
-->
In March 2001, Kevin helped a few developers to move all Bochs activities from
bochs.com to a new site at <ulink url="http://bochs.sourceforge.net"></ulink>.  Since then the Bochs project
has settled into its new home, and around release times has even hit #1 most
active project of the week at SourceForge.
</para>
</section><!-- end: What is Bochs? -->

<section id="who-uses-bochs"><title>Who uses Bochs?</title>
<para> It is hard to estimate how many people have tried Bochs or use it on a
regular basis, but a few statistics give an indication.  The &devlist;,
which is the primary source of news on bugs and releases, has over 400
subscribers. The latest version has been downloaded over 150,000 times
from SourceForge, not counting any mirror website or SVN users.
</para>

<para>
Bochs has many possible uses, and different people use it for different
things.  Many people use it to run applications in a second operating system
without needing two different computers or dual-booting.  Running
Windows software on a non-x86 workstation or on an x86 Unix box are common
uses.  Also, because every hardware instruction and every line of simulator
code is accessible, Bochs is used extensively for debugging new operating
systems.  If you were writing boot code for your home-brewed
x86 operating system and it didn't work right, booting it in Bochs could
give you great visibility into what is really going on.  The Bochs
debugger lets you simulate quickly or slowly, pausing whenever you want
to look at the contents of memory or the CPU registers.  Or, if you
wanted to study which parts of a program take the most time, you could use
Bochs to measure how often certain pieces of the code were executed.
</para>

<para>
Bochs has been used as a teaching tool in Operating Systems classes, in which
students used and modified it to learn how the PC hardware works.  As a final
project the students had to add a new peripheral device, so they had to learn
all about I/O ports, interrupts, and device drivers.  In industry, it is used
to support legacy applications on modern hardware, and as a reference model
when testing new x86-compatible hardware.
</para>

<para>
There may be as many uses of Bochs as there are users.  Do you want to run
your old DOS games?  Or learn how to program under GNU/Linux, without leaving your
Windows desktop?  Or reverse engineer your printer driver?  You decide.
</para>

</section>  <!-- end of Introduction:Who uses Bochs? section -->


<section id="is-bochs-right-for-me"><title>Is Bochs right for me?</title>
<para>
Bochs is very useful for some applications, and not well suited to others.
This section tries to answer the question, "Is Bochs right for me?"
</para>

<para>Bochs may or may not be right for you, depending on what it is you want to do.
Perhaps all you want to do is run one or two applications native to Microsoft Windows
on GNU/Linux, or vice-versa.  Perhaps your biggest concern is speed and performance.
Maybe you don't mind tweaking a few files here and there when you want another application
to work in that setting.
In cases where the objective is to simulate x86 hardware on an x86, VirtualBox, Wine, and
VMware might be your best options.</para>

<para>
On the other hand, perhaps you have a vital application running on an older operating
system that only runs well on old hardware.  You are concerned that the life cycle of
this hardware is coming to an end, and your backup and restoration hardware and tools
no longer suffice for the amount of data that you have.  You need to transfer backup
disk images over a network, and want to use modern procedures for hardware maintenance.
Perhaps the application is important enough to run on a larger computer, such as a
64-bit machine, or even a mainframe.  Bochs would be an excellent option in such a scenario.
</para>

<para>
Perhaps your objective is to debug software or hardware drivers.  Bochs offers a controlled
environment that can better assist you in determining cause and effect relationships.
You can take snapshots that show you what is going on behind the scenes.
You can isolate the line that caused that crash.  You can have multiple
images and compare them under a microscope.
In these situation, Bochs could save you time and resources.
</para>

<para>
Information Technology changes faster than any other field.
It is very easy to forget transitional software that came and went.
But history is important to all fields, and to build on the future,
it is important to understand the past.  Computer programmers, however,
do not have the same advantage as an architect, who can, for example,
take a trip to Greece and touch a pillar.  Much of the history of Computer
Science is left on corroding floppies and malfunctioning hardware.
Bochs gives you the benefit of having one or more complete environments
where you can understand firsthand the behavior of operating systems and
programs.  This cannot be achieved with an "emulator" such as Wine.
</para>

</section>  <!-- end of Introduction:Is Bochs right for me? section -->

<section id="will-it-work-for-me"><title>Will it work for me?</title>

<para>
Whether Bochs works for you depends on your host hardware, host operating
system, guest operating system, guest software, and your ability to work in
a command-line environment using documentation.  There is no wizard to help
you through the setup process.  You do not get a recovery or installation
disk to assist you in the process of installing a guest operating system.
Bochs only provides you with the "virtual hardware", and it is up to you to do the rest.
</para>

<para>Bochs will run on Windows, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or MacOSX.
If you are running on x86 hardware, you have a range of choices.
Check the installation section for your host platform to see what options
Bochs supports on your platform.  If the most important factor is speed,
you may want to try a virtualization product instead of Bochs (VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU).
</para>

<para>
If you are using a non-x86 machine, then Bochs is one of the few choices for
running x86 software.  Bochs has been known to work on Solaris (Sparc),
GNU/Linux (PowerPC/Alpha), MacOS (PowerPC), IRIX (MIPS), Digital Unix (Alpha),
and AIX (PowerPC).
</para>

<para>
You can also find more detailed testing information on the testing
status page on the &bochswebsite;.
<!-- DISABLED: testing status page has been removed because it was so out of
date...  The testing status page tells which combinations of host platform and
guest platform have been tried by other Bochs users. -->

  <row>
    <entry>Simulate a Multiprocessor</entry>
    <entry>Yes</entry>
    <entry>Bochs can be configured to simulate up to 254 processor threads.  This
    feature is still experimental, but it can boot several Linux or Windows guests
    with SMP support.  Please note that this does NOT mean that Bochs can run
    faster on a physical SMP machine.

     <question>
       <para>How do you pronounce "Bochs"?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
       <para>
       Phonetically the same as the English word "box". It's just a play on the word "box", since techies like to call their machines a "Linux box", "Windows box", ... Bochs emulates a box inside a box.

     <question>
       <para>Who is the author of Bochs?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
       <para>
       Kevin Lawton is the primary author of Bochs. There have been bug fixes,
       enhancements, and code contributions from some few hundred people, so
       it is not possible to list them all. Later, Kevin had been working on a
       PC virtualization project called <ulink
       url="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/plex86">plex86</ulink>. In Fall 2002, he
       made contributed some major CPU speedups and helped with integration
       and debugging of the x86-64 emulation code.

     <question><para>
     Who maintains Bochs now?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
      With Kevin's help, in April 2001, the members of the &devlist;
      set up a new official Bochs site hosted by <ulink url="http://sourcefourge.net">Source Forge</ulink>.
      The admins on this project are Greg Alexander, Don Becker, Christophe Bothamy,
      Bryce Denney, Volker Ruppert and Stanislav Shwartsman.

  <qandaentry>
     <question><para>
     Tell me about performance when running Bochs.
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     Because Bochs emulates every x86 instruction and all the devices in a PC
     system, it does not reach high emulation speeds. Users who have an x86
     processor and want the highest emulation speeds may want to consider PC
     virtualization software such as Vmware or VirtualBox (free software).

     <question><para>
     Does Bochs use a disk partition to install the OS?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     No. It uses a disk image file, which is simply a large file, like any other file, on your platform's disk.

  <qandaentry>
     <question><para>
     Why can't I use Bochs with my current WinXP installation?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     Think about this. If you had two different PC's, they would require different
     hardware drivers. So you may not be able to safely move a disk drive with WinXP
     on it, from one to the other. Bochs is no different. It emulates a certain set
     of hardware devices, and requires each OS be configured for those devices.

<section id="downloading"><title>Downloading Bochs</title>

<para>
You can download Bochs from our web site at &bochs-sf-net;.  First, you
need to choose what version to get: a recent release or a development
version.  If you trying to get things working for the first time, a release
version is recommended since it has been tested the most.  The development
versions (sometimes called SVN snapshots) may have some newer bug fixes and
new features, but have not been tested as much as the releases.
</para>

<para>
Second, you can choose to compile Bochs from source code or install a binary
(if one is available for your platform).  Binary packages will be quicker to
install, and most include a small demo of a guest operating system called DLX
Linux to get you started.  However, some features can only be enabled if you
compile Bochs yourself, for example the Bochs debugger.  For multiuser systems,
you will probably need system administrator privileges (root) to install a
binary package.  If you decide to get a binary, download it to your hard disk,
uncompress it, then go to the section called <link
linkend="install-binary">Installing a Binary</link> for more information.
</para>

<para>
If you are going to compile Bochs yourself, you need the gzipped tarball
containing the source code, called
<filename>bochs-<replaceable>version</replaceable>.tar.gz</filename>.  For
Windows and Mac, the prebuilt Makefiles are separate, so also get
the Makefiles for your platform.  To unpack a compressed TAR file<footnote>
<para>
A TAR file is a single file that contains many files packed inside.  Bochs
TAR files are compressed with a program called gzip, and another program
called gunzip is used to uncompress them.
</para>
</footnote> on a Unix machine<footnote>
<para>
On Windows, look for software called WinZip to unpack the TAR.
</para>
</footnote>
, type
<screen>
  gunzip -c bochs-<replaceable>version</replaceable>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
</screen>
This creates a directory called
<filename>bochs-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename> full of
files.  This directory will be referred to as &bochsdir;.  Go into
&bochsdir; and you are ready to compile.  Instructions for compiling
Bochs are in the section, <link linkend="compiling">Compiling Bochs</link>.
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, you can also obtain the sources for any Bochs version using SVN.
See the <link linkend="get-src-svn">SVN instructions</link> for details.

<section id="get-src-svn"><title>Tracking the source code with SVN</title>
<para>
SVN (Subversion) is a tool used by many software developers to manage changes
within their source code tree. SVN provides the means to store not only the
current version of a piece of source code, but a record of all changes (and who
made those changes) that have occurred to that source code. Use of SVN is
particularly common on projects with multiple developers, since SVN ensures
changes made by one developer are not accidentally removed when another
developer posts their changes to the source tree. The Bochs source code and
documentation are available using SVN<footnote>
<para>
You can download SVN software and documentation from
<ulink url="http://subversion.apache.org">subversion.apache.org</ulink>.
</para>

</para>

<section><title>Checking out Bochs</title>
<para>
When you have SVN installed, the first step is to do a checkout. The initial
checkout command is long and ugly, but usually you only have to do it
once. The example below shows the SVN checkout process of the Bochs trunk in Unix.
On the Windows platform, you can download a SVN client from
<ulink url="http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows">subversion.apache.org</ulink>,
or use SVN within Cygwin<footnote>

<para>
The SVN checkout process (above) gives you a directory called <filename>bochs</filename>
that contains the very latest source code.  I will refer to this directory
as &bochsdir;.  In this directory there's also a subdirectory called ".svn"
which tells the SVN software where the code was checked out, what version
you have, and where to go for future updates.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Getting the Latest Version</title>
<para>
Most developers use SVN to always give them the latest source code.  The minute
that any developer checks in a change, they are available to everyone else
through SVN. You just have to type <command>svn update</command> in the
&bochsdir; directory, and SVN will retrieve any files and directories that have
been changed since you did a checkout.  If you update regularly, each update
takes a short time because it downloads only the files that changed.
See also <link linkend="svn-release-version">Getting a release version</link>.
</para>

<para>
The <command>svn update</command> command tells you if any new files have
been downloaded from the server, and it also tells you if you have modified any
of the SVN-controlled files.  As it checks through the source directories, it
will list files that have changed, with a single letter before the name that
tells the status of that file.  The most common status letters are listed
below.

<para>
This section is divided up by platform, since installing a binary package
is different on different platforms.
</para>

<section><title>Windows</title>
<para>
The Bochs binaries for Windows are distributed in an EXE installer package.
The Bochs installer can be started like any other Windows program and it brings
up the installation wizard. Here you can select the destination folder and the
installation options. The wizard installs the files and creates the registry
keys, start menu and desktop links.
</para>
<para>
Previous releases of Bochs were distributed as ZIP packages, too. These packages
contained the same set of files as the installer package from the same version.
</para>
<para>
If you are new to Bochs you should try out the DLX Linux demo distributed with
Bochs. The installation wizard has created a link on the desktop if you decided
to install the demo. If you doubleclick the icon two windows will appear:
one is the Bochs Display window, and the other is text window that is used for
the runtime configuration and for log messages if no logfile is specified.
</para>
<para>
You can find more information on the DLX Linux demo in the next section below the
DLX Linux screenshot.

<title>Linux RPM</title>
<para>
RPM stands for "RedHat Package Manager."  An RPM is a compressed file
containing files to be installed on your system.  Many Linux distributions,
not just RedHat ones, can install files from an RPM.  First, download the
Bochs RPM for your architecture to your computer.  For example, if you have an
Intel-compatible computer, be sure to get the RPM that says "for Linux x86
distributions" or "i386".  Once you have the package on your local disk, you
should become the root user and install it as follows<footnote>
<para>
Many distributions have their own RPM installer program, often graphical, and
they should work ok.  It is helpful to be able to see the text output from
RPM, so if you use a fancy RPM installer, be sure to find the text output and
check that it looks correct.
</para>
</footnote>:

  user$ _
</screen>
</figure>
</para>

<para>
All RPM installations are done as the root user because they require
permission to update system files and directories.  If you do not have root
access you need to compile Bochs in your home directory.
</para>

<para>
RPM installation can fail for a few reasons.  It will fail if you already
have a Bochs package installed.  In this case, try upgrading the old package
to the new package with <command>rpm --upgrade NAME.i386.rpm</command>.
Another potential problem is missing RPM dependencies.  If you are getting
errors about missing files or RPMs, then first you should try to
install the RPMs that provide the missing pieces.  If that cannot be done,
download the source RPM and build a new binary RPM that is appropriate
for your platform.  The command is <command>rpmbuild --rebuild
NAME.src.rpm</command>.  As a last resort, you can run rpm with the
<command>--nodeps</command> option to ignore dependencies and install it
anyway, but if it is missing important pieces it may not run properly.
</para>

<para>
The Bochs RPM installs five new commands and associated manual pages: bochs,
bochs-dlx and bximage.  First, let's try out the
DLX Linux demo by typing <command>bochs-dlx</command>.

<screen>

  To run the DLX Linux demo, I need to create a directory called
  /usr/users/bryce/.bochsdlx, and copy some configuration files
  and a 10 megabyte disk image into the directory.

  Is that okay? [y/n]

Then you get a new X11 window containing the VGA display of the simulated
machine.  First you see the VGA BIOS screen, then Linux uncompresses and
boots, and you get a login prompt.  Type "root" and ENTER to log in to
DLX linux.

</para>

<para>
Booting is complete when you see "dlx login:" and a cursor.  At this login
prompt, type "root".  On UNIX systems, root is the system admin user.
There is no password for root on this sample disk image, so it lets you log
in without typing any password.  Now you should see a UNIX prompt, and you
can begin to type UNIX commands.

The MacOS X binary distribution is a mountable disk
image (.dmg file). Once you've downloaded the binary
distribution file, just double click
on it to automatically unpack the archive and mount
the volume on the desktop.  An icon will appear
exactly as if you'd inserted a CD-ROM
or removable storage device, and a finder window
containing the volume should automatically open.
It is likely to have an odd name
such as _dmg_top, but don't worry about that.
</para>
<para>
Copy the Bochs-2.0 (or whatever version) folder from
the disk image onto your hard disk.  Either Home or
Applications would be sensible places to put it.
Because the disk image is mounted read only, you
can't run the included dlxlinux guest OS until
you've copied it to the hard disk.
</para>
<para>
Once you've installed the binaries, it's probably a
good idea to drag the _dmg_top volume to trash to
unmount it, so you don't get confused and try to
run bochs from there.  Then open
the bochs folder from wherever you installed it.
</para>
<para>
The MacOS X version of bochs requires a terminal
window to run. If you just double click on the Bochs
icon, you'll get an error message telling you to
double click on "bochs.scpt" to start
Bochs in a new terminal window.  You'll need to
configure Bochs before you will get very far with
the bochs.scpt in the top folder,
so to try out bochs open the dlxlinux folder and
double click on the bochs.scpt icon inside.
</para>
<para>
This will open a new terminal window which will
contain the Bochs startup messages, and a
configuration menu.  The default option is
[5], which starts the simulation, so press enter to
do so.  You will then get a new window containing
the VGA display of the simulated
machine.  The new window will probably appear behind
the current terminal window, so either click on the
bochs icon in the dock or the simulation window to
bring it to the front.  If you're quick
enough you'll then see the VGA BIOS screen, then
Linux  uncompresses and boots, and you get a login
prompt.  Type "root" and ENTER to log in to DLX Linux.
</para>
<para>
Once you've finished playing with DLX Linux, just
type "reboot" in the Bochs window to shut down the
DLX Linux operating system, and
when it starts to reboot again press the "Power"
button in the "MacBochs Hardware Controls" window
(it's the circle containing a vertical bar at the
far right - have a look at the Linux screenshots,
since the Mac version doesn't seem to have
descriptions or tool-tips).

<section id="compiling"><title>Compiling Bochs</title>

<section><title>Standard Compile</title>
<para>
Bochs is written in C++, so you need a C++ compiler on your system.  Most
platforms have been tested with GNU gcc/g++, but other compilers are known
to work too.  By now, you should have unpacked your source TAR file or checked
out Bochs from SVN.  If not, you can return to <link
linkend="downloading">Downloading Bochs</link> for details.  The top level
directory of the source code will be referred to as &bochsdir;.  (&bochsdir;
contains the files <filename>bochs.h</filename> and
<filename>main.cc</filename> and subdirectories <filename>cpu</filename> and
<filename>bios</filename>.)
</para>

<para>
The standard compile process has three basic steps:
<command>configure</command>, <command>make</command>, and <command>make
install</command>.  Each step is described in a separate section below.  The
standard compile process is used on all Unix machines, MacOS X, and
Cygwin (win32).  There are separate instructions for <link
linkend="compiling-win32">compiling for Win32 with Microsoft VC++</link>.
</para>

<section id="configure"><title>Configure</title>

<para>
There is a script called <command>configure</command> which tests your
machine, C/C++ compiler and libraries to discover what settings should work on
your system.  If you run <command>configure</command> with no arguments after
it, defaults will be used for all settings.  To change the settings, you can
run <command>configure</command> with options that override the
defaults.  You can get a list of valid configure options by typing
<command>configure --help</command>.  One useful configure option is
--prefix=<replaceable>directory</replaceable>, which sets the directory in
which Bochs will be installed.  All the possible configure options are
documented in a <link linkend="config-opts">later section</link>.


</para>

<para>
Among other things, the configure script tries to detect your platform
and which compile options to use.  If you want to control this, set these
environment variables before running configure: <varname>CC</varname>,
<varname>CXX</varname>, <varname>CFLAGS</varname>,
<varname>CXXFLAGS</varname>.  Here is an example that sets the environment
variables, using bash/ksh<footnote>
<para>
The syntax for bash and ksh is given.  In csh and variants, use the syntax
<command>setenv <replaceable>VARIABLE</replaceable>
<replaceable>value</replaceable></command> to change environment variables.
Do not use an equal sign for csh!
</para>
</footnote>
syntax:
<screen>
  export CC=egcs
  export CXX="$CC"
  export CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -m486 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe"
  export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Once the configure script knows what options are selected,
it creates a Makefile in every source code directory, and creates
<filename>$BOCHS/config.h</filename> with all the option values written
as preprocessor #defines.  Now the sources are ready to compile.
</para>

<section><title>Configure Shortcut Scripts</title>
<para>
In the Bochs source directory, you will see a series of scripts called
<filename>.conf.<replaceable>platform</replaceable></filename>.
These scripts run the <command>configure</command> script for you, with a set of
options that are appropriate for that platform.  It is not necessary to
use the shortcut scripts; they are simply there to show you an example that
the developers have used. Some of these scripts have been used to build official
binary packages.

<tip>
<para>
If a shortcut script is "almost right" for you, just edit it and then run it!
If you run a shortcut script, you don't need to run configure manually.
</para>
</tip>

Run a shortcut script using Bourne shell, like this:
<screen>
  sh .conf.win32-vcpp
</screen>

These <filename>.conf.<replaceable>platform</replaceable></filename> have
been tested in recent Bochs versions:
<screen>
  .conf.linux
  .conf.sparc
  .conf.macos
  .conf.macosx
  .conf.win32-vcpp
  .conf.win32-cygwin
</screen>
</para>

</section> <!-- end of Configure Shortcut Scripts -->

</section> <!-- end of Compiling:Unix:Configure -->


<section><title>Make</title>
<para>
The <command>make</command> command compiles Bochs.  Make is a program
used by many software projects that reads the &Makefile; in each source
directory and follows the instructions that it finds there.  A &Makefile; tells
which files depend on which other files, what commands to use to compile and
link the code, and more.  After you have finished the configure step, just type
<command>make</command> to build the source code.
</para>

<para>
The reason that make is so popular is that it is smart about when to compile
and when not to compile.  If you run make once, it compiles every file.  But
when you run it again, it checks to see if any source files have been modified;
if not, there's nothing to do!  For example, the &Makefile; says that
<filename>main.o</filename> depends on <filename>main.cc</filename>.  Knowing
this, it will only compile <filename>main.cc</filename> if it is newer than
<filename>main.o</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Of course, make can only do the right thing if the &Makefile; lists all the
dependencies correctly, so human error can sometimes lead make astray.
If make refuses to build something that you think it should, or you
are getting strange compile errors, try doing <command>make all-clean</command>
and then <command>make</command> again.  All-clean means to clean up
the compiled files in every subdirectory, while <command>make clean</command>
means to clean up just the current directory<footnote>

<para>
This is different from the terminology of some other projects, and it may cause
confusion.  Sometimes "clean" implies that all subdirectories are affected.
</para>
</footnote>.  However, it's important to note that <command>make
all-clean</command> leaves the configuration intact.  You do not have
to run <command>configure</command> again.
</para>

<para>
If you're really in the mood for cleaning, <command>make dist-clean</command>
erases all the configuration information too.  In theory, after a dist-clean
your directory should look much like when you first untarred it or checked it
out.  There's usually some extra stuff lying around, but the &Makefile; tries
at least to erase any files that it created.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Make Install</title>
<para>
Once the program has been built, the next step is typically to run
<command>make install</command> to copy the executables, documentation, and
other required files into a public place so that all users can use it.
By default the files are copied to some directories in /usr/local. The following
tables shows the directories and their contents.

<section id="config-opts"><title>Configure Options</title>
<para>
This section describes the configure options for Bochs.  Perhaps the most
important option is <option>--help</option>, since it gives you a list of all
the other options.  The configure script will detect your platform and choose
the default GUI for your platform.  If the default choice is not what you
want, use the <option>--with-*</option> options to override the default.  The
options in the first table tell which GUI library is the default for each
platform.  Starting in version 2.0, you can use multiple
<option>--with-*</option> options at once to compile with multiple
display libraries, and then choose between them at runtime with the
<link linkend="bochsopt-displaylibrary">display_library option</link>
in the configuration file. Or, you can
let the configure script detect which libraries are on your system
and use them all, by configuring with <option>--with-all-libs</option>.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The concept of platform detection and default GUIs was added in Bochs 1.4.
In Bochs 1.3 and before, the X11 GUI was always the default.

      Plugins are shared libraries that can be loaded on demand.  Example: the

      called libbx_serial.so.  When Bochs reads its configuration file, if the

      Compile in support for SMP simulation.  This allows you to boot Linux and
      maybe other OSes in SMP mode, and bochs will simulate all the different
      CPUs and communication between them.  Do not expect this option to speed
      up your simulation!  On the contrary, it has to spend extra time simulating
      the different CPUs (even if they're mostly idle) and the communication
      between them. Use it to try out an SMP OS if you don't have an SMP machine,
      or to debug SMP OS drivers. Refer to <xref linkend="SMP"> for more details
      on SMP in Bochs.

<section id="compiling-win32"><title>Compiling on Win32 with Microsoft VC++</title>
<para>
The standard compile uses the configure script, but the Windows platform
cannot run the configure script natively.
The current solution to this problem is that the Bochs
configure script must be run on a different platform that does support
shell scripts, with options that cause it to configure for a Win32
platform instead of the native one.  Many people have access to a UNIX
machine that could run the configure script, or you can use Cygwin or
MinGW/MSYS to run the configure script.
<footnote>
<para>
Because Bochs depends so much on the configure script, if you are doing
much win32 Bochs development, you should consider downloading Cygwin or
MinGW/MSYS so that you can run the configure step natively.
</para>
</footnote>.
</para>

<para>
Download the Bochs sources on a machine that can run shell scripts.
Edit the configure shortcut script <filename>.conf.win32-vcpp</filename>
if you want to adjust the configure options.  Then type these commands
in the Bochs source directory:
<screen>
  sh .conf.win32-vcpp
  make win32_snap
</screen>
These commands will run the configure step, produce VC++ makefiles and
workspace files, and pack it all into a .zip file in the directory above the
source directory <footnote>
<para>
If the source directory is <filename>/home/joe/bochs-win32</filename>, the
resulting .zip file is in <filename>/home/joe/bochs-win32-msvc-src.zip</filename>.
</para>
</footnote>.  The .zip file is all ready to transfer to the target Windows
machine to be unzipped and compiled.  Or, if you run the sh/make steps in
Cygwin, you are already on the target machine so you don't need the .zip
file.
</para>

<para>
When you have the Win32 sources transferred to a Windows machine with VC++,
find the workspace file called <filename>bochs.sln</filename> in the folder
"vs2013" and load it in VC++. Choose <command>Project:Set Active Project</command>
and be sure that "bochs" is selected. Then choose <command>Build:Build bochs.exe</command>.
This will build all the required libraries (iodev, cpu, etc.) and the auxiliary
programs <filename>bximage.exe</filename>, <filename>bxhub.exe</filename> and
<filename>niclist.exe</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Using workspaces is easy and intuitive, but there is one caveat. The workspaces
come directly out of a ZIP file in <filename>build/win32/vs2013ex-workspace.zip</filename>,
and they are not controlled by the configure script. When you compile with certain
configure options (e.g. <option>--with-sdl</option>) you need to link with additional
libraries. For now you must add them to the VC++ workspace by hand. In version 2.0,
we have improved the situation considerably by adding #if...#endif around every optional
file and including nearly every Bochs source file in the workspace.  This solves the
problem of having to manually add source files to the workspace when you turn
on configure options such as <option>--enable-debugger</option>. The problem of adding
link libraries remains unresolved.
</para>

<tip>
<para>
To compile with the Bochs debugger enabled, add <option>--enable-debugger</option>
to the configure line in <filename>.conf.win32-vcpp</filename> before running it.
No modifications to the workspace are necessary.
</para> </tip>

<para>
An alternative way to compile is to run <filename>nmake.exe</filename> in an
MS-DOS window.  Instead of using the workspace files, nmake uses the Bochs
makefiles that are generated by configure. The nmake method is currently used
to build the release binaries.
</para>

<para>
The <command>make install</command> doesn't work with nmake yet. Currently
it must be run inside of Cygwin or MinGW/MSYS and requires the environment
variable <emphasis>INSTDIR</emphasis> to be set.
</para>

</section>  <!-- end of Compiling:win32 -->

<section id="compile-cygwin"><title>Compiling on Win32 with Cygwin or MinGW/MSYS</title>
<para>Cygwin is a free Unix-like environment for Windows written by
Steve Chamberlain and now maintained by RedHat, Inc.  You can download
it from <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</ulink>.  Because
Cygwin supports the configure script and uses GNU gcc/g++, you can use the
standard compile process.  The configure script should automatically detect
Cygwin and add "-mno-cygwin -DWIN32" to the compiler options.  You should
get a working Bochs if you just type:
<screen>
  configure
  make
</screen>

Optionally, you can use the configure shortcut script for Cygwin,
<filename>.conf.win32-cygwin</filename>, instead of running configure
directly.  If this script is close to what you need, just edit the script and
then run it.  To use the configure shortcut script and compile in Cygwin, the
commands are
<screen>
  sh .conf.win32-cygwin
  make
</screen>
To find out the options which are known to work in Cygwin, open the file
<filename>.conf.win32-cygwin</filename> in any text editor/viewer and have
a look at the end of that file.
</para>
<para>
When using gcc 4.7 or newer you need to add the switch <emphasis>-mno-ms-bitfields</emphasis>
to the CFLAGS, to make sure that hdimage and network structures are packed as
expected.
</para>
<para>
The command <emphasis>make install</emphasis> installs the Bochs files in the directory
structure of your build environment. To install Bochs into any desired folder you
need to use the <emphasis>install_win32</emphasis> target. It requires the environment
variable <emphasis>INSTDIR</emphasis> to be set.
</para>

<section id="compile-macos9-codewarrior"><title>Compiling on MacOS 9 with CodeWarrior</title>
<para>
  It is possible that this hasn't been tried since 1999. In theory, you
  run <command>sh .conf.macos</command> on a Unix box to build the
  makefiles and headers, copy the whole thing over to a Mac, and then
  use CodeWarrior to compile. Since it hasn't been tested in so long,
  it is quite likely that some work is needed to bring the Mac port up
  to date.
</para>
<para>
  If you are interested and have the required MacOS development tools, please
  let us know by contacting the &devlist;. Someone requests a MacOS port
  almost once a month, but none of the developers know how to help them.

<para>
The port to MacOS X with Carbon API by Emmanuel Mailliard is quite new, and the
configure and makefile support was added by Bryce Denney.  You will need
the compiler and libraries from the development tools CD.  Bochs should
configure and compile with the Carbon GUI if you simply type:
<screen>
  configure
  make
</screen>
Optionally, you can use the configure shortcut script for MacOS X,
<filename>.conf.macosx</filename>, instead of running configure directly.
If this script is close to what you need, just edit the script and then
run it.  To use the configure shortcut script and compile, the commands
are
<screen>
  sh .conf.macosx
  make
</screen>

MacOS X has a special format for an application bundle, which looks like a
directory that contains the required resource files and binaries.  The Makefile
currently creates this application bundle "by hand" using mkdir and copy, which
is surely the wrong way to do it.  Bryce doesn't know the official way to
create an application from a Makefile, so this hack will remain until a real
Mac developer helps to clean it up.
</para>

<para>
On MacOS X the default GUI is the Carbon interface, but you can also try other
Bochs GUIs. Use <option>--with-x11</option> for X windows,
<option>--with-rfb</option> for VNC/RFB, <option>--with-sdl</option> for SDL
or <option>--with-sdl2</option> for SDL2.
</para>
</section><!-- end: Compiling on MacOS X -->

<section id="compile-morphos"><title>Compiling on Amiga/MorphOS</title>
<para>
  Nicholai Benalal created this port to MorphOS running on Amiga. It should
  compile with:
<screen>
  configure
  make
</screen>
  If the platform is not detected properly, you might need to use
  <option>--enable-amigaos</option> as a configure option. Optionally, you
  can use the configure shortcut script, <filename>.conf.amigaos</filename>.
</para>
</section><!-- end: Compiling on Amiga/MorphOS -->

<section id="compile-rfb"><title>Compiling with the RFB interface</title>
<para>
  The RFB code was written by Don Becker <email>x-odus@iname.com</email>,
  who has a Bochs-RFB web page on his site,
  <ulink url="http://www.psyon.org/bochs-rfb/">http://www.psyon.org/bochs-rfb/</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
  This interface allows you to view the Bochs display with
  AT&amp;T's <ulink url="http://www.realvnc.com/">VNC Viewer</ulink>.
  The protocol used between a VNC server and a VNC viewer is called RFB.
  Because the RFB code in Bochs is written with portable network socket
  and POSIX thread code, it can be compiled on many platforms and has
  been tested in Linux and Win32. No additional libraries are required.
  To try it, type:
<screen>
  configure --with-rfb
  make
</screen>
  RFB currently uses this setup:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>port range 5900 to 5949 (using the first one available)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>no authentification</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>by default 30 seconds waiting for client</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>8 bpp (BGR233) supported only</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>if client doesn't support resize: desktop size 720x480 (for text mode and standard VGA)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>if resize supported: maximum resolution 1280x1024</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
With the display library option "timeout" the default value of 30 seconds can
be changed. With a value of 0 it is possible to start the simulation without a
client connected.

<section id="compile-vncsrv"><title>Compiling with the VNCSRV interface</title>
<para>
  The <ulink url="http://libvnc.github.io/">LibVNCServer</ulink> is
  a cross-platform library that allows to implement VNC server functionality easily.
  On platforms supported by LibVNCServer Bochs can be compiled with support for
  it this way:
<screen>
  configure --with-vncsrv
  make
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Unlike the RFB GUI this new implementation is not limited to 8 bpp and it is
possible to connect a Bochs session with a web browser.
</para>
</section><!-- end compile-vncsrv -->

<section id="compile-sdl"><title>Compiling with the SDL interface</title>
<para>
  Dave Poirier has written an SDL interface for Bochs. Simple DirectMedia
  Layer, or SDL, is a cross-platform multimedia library distributed from
  <ulink url="http://libsdl.org/">libsdl.org</ulink>. SDL is available
  for many platforms including Win32, Linux, BSD, IRIX, MacOS, MacOS X,
  and AmigaOS.
</para>
<para>
  To compile Bochs with SDL, you must first install the SDL library
  from <ulink url="http://libsdl.org/">libsdl.org</ulink>. You
  can either get the source code and compile it yourself, or install
  the development libraries for your platform (already compiled).
  Then, go into the Bochs directory and type:
<screen>
  configure --with-sdl
  make
</screen>
</para>
<para>
  If you are on FreeBSD and have SDL installed using the ports collection, Bochs
  won't be able to find the library automatically, as the SDL config script is
  called <filename>sdl11-config</filename> in that case (even for version 1.2).
  The easiest way to make Bochs find it, is to create a symlink to that script
  called <filename>sdl-config</filename> inside a directory which is in the path.
  For example:
<screen>
  ln -s /usr/local/bin/sdl11-config ~/bin/sdl-config
</screen>
</para>
<para>
To compile in Microsoft VS2013Ex, you have to configure on a different system
(see <link linkend="compiling-win32">Compiling on Win32 with Microsoft VC++</link>).
Before running the configure script, you have to add <option>--with-sdl</option>
to the shortcut script. If you have already configured, you can set <command>BX_WITH_SDL
</command> to 1 in <filename>config.h</filename>.
</para>
<para>
Then you have to set up the project for SDL this way:
<screen>
- add source file <filename>sdl.cc</filename> to the module <command>gui</command>
- add path to the SDL include files to the modules <command>bochs</command> and <command>gui</command>
- add lbraries <filename>SDL.lib</filename> and <filename>SDLmain.lib</filename> to the module <filename>bochs</filename>
- change the runtime library for all modules to <command>Multithreaded-DLL (/MD)</command>
</screen>
Compiling with MSVC <command>nmake</command> is not supported yet.
</para>
</section><!-- end compile-sdl -->

<section id="compile-sdl2"><title>Compiling with the SDL version 2 interface</title>
<para>
The SDL library version 2 is now also supported by Bochs. For some basic information
about SDL, see <xref linkend="compile-sdl">. The configure option to enable SDL2
support is <option>--with-sdl2</option> and the configuration script is called
<command>sdl2-config</command>. Note that the Bochs guis for SDL version 1.2.x
and 2.x are mutually exclusive. The legacy SDL gui support will be removed someday.
When using the gui library autodetection (<option>--with-all-libs</option>) the
configure script probes for SDL version 2 first.
</para>
</section><!-- end compile-sdl2 -->

<section id="compile-wx">
<title>Compiling with the wxWidgets interface</title>
<para>
  wxWidgets is a cross-platform C++ user interface library which
  you can download for free at <ulink url="http://wxwidgets.org/">wxwidgets.org</ulink>.
  The wxWidgets port of Bochs provides both a graphical configuration interface for
  editing <filename>bochsrc</filename> options (see
  <link linkend="bochsopt-configinterface">config_interface option</link>) and a
  display (see <link linkend="bochsopt-displaylibrary">display_library option</link>).
  It was written by Bryce Denney, Don Becker, Dave Poirier, and Volker Ruppert.
<screen>
  configure --with-wx
  make
</screen>
</para>
<para>
  If you want Bochs to use a wxWidgets installation not in your path (but installed
  somewhere else), you need to set the WX_CONFIG environment variable to the
  proper wx-config script, before running configure (example for csh):
<screen>
  setenv WX_CONFIG '/home/compile/wx/bin/wx-config'
</screen>
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Building an RPM on Linux</title>
<para>
RPM stands for "RedHat Package Manager."  An RPM is a compressed file
containing files to be installed on your system.  Bochs
has a special shell script called <filename>make-rpm</filename> that helps
to build an RPM of Bochs.  Start with a clean source directory.  Edit
.conf.linux first if you want to adjust the configure options.
Then, type:

<screen>
  ./build/redhat/make-rpm | tee /tmp/build.txt
</screen>

When this command completes, you should have a source RPM and a binary RPM of
Bochs in the current directory.  The <command>tee</command> part of the
command (optional) saves a transcript of the build process into /tmp/build.txt,
which is very useful if anything goes wrong.  Instructions for installing an
RPM are <link linkend="linuxrpm">here</link>.
</para>

<note><para>
In the past, you had to build rpms as root, but as of version 2.0 you can build
them as a normal user.
</para></note>

<section><title>Compile Problems</title>

<section><title>The configure script failed</title>
<para>
The <command>configure</command> script can fail for various reasons. If the error
message on the shell doesn't give enough information, it is recommended to review
the output file <filename>config.log</filename> to find out what exactly
happened. The following issues can be fixed by modifying the configure options used:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>deprecated option (option from previous Bochs version not needed /
  supported anymore)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>mutually exclusive option (e.g. <option>--enable-debugger</option> and <option>--enable-gdb-stub</option>)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>dependent option (e.g. USB support requires PCI support)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>incomplete option (e.g. <option>--enable-cpu-level</option> requires an argument)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>development package for library not installed (e.g. for <option>--with-wx</option>)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
If the configure issue cannot be fixed by option changes and / or installing
development packages / tools it should be reported in the &devlist; or the <link linkend="sf-trackers">SF bug
tracker</link> for the Bochs project.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Make / compilation failure</title>
<para>
The <command>make</command> utility itself can only fail if the specified target
is not supported by the environment or simply doesn't exist. In most cases the programs
called from <command>make</command> are causing the failure (e.g. compiler / linker).
</para>
<para>
In some cases it might be useful to rebuild Bochs completely by calling
<command>make dist-clean</command> and running the <command>configure</command>
script once again. These steps are recommended if the development sources from
SVN are used and one of the build system files (e.g. <filename>Makefile</filename>
or <filename>config.h.in</filename>) has been changed.
</para>
<para>
Sometimes it is possible to isolate the failing piece of code by disabling one or
more configure options. For example, if the compilation fails somewhere in the cpu/avx*
files, it might help to configure without <option>--enable-avx</option>. The same
could be done with other Bochs facilities controlled by configure options.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Runtime issues with self-compiled Bochs</title>
<para>
After a successful compilation the self-compiled Bochs can fail if at least one
library is not installed properly. This can happen if the library consists of a
development and a runtime package and the second one is missing. Another problem
can appear on build environments like Cygwin and MinGW/MSYS. Applications built
there are usually designed to be run inside of the environment. When starting
them from the Windows shell, it may cause errors like "missing <filename>cygwin1.dll</filename>"
or similar. In that case, the missing DLL must be copied from e.g. the Cygwin folder
to the location of the compiled EXE file.

<section><title>What does Bochs need?</title>
<para>
These are the minimum requirements for running an OS inside of Bochs:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
the Bochs executable
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
the BIOS image (usually called <filename>BIOS-bochs-latest</filename>)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
the VGA BIOS image (e.g. <filename>VGABIOS-lgpl-latest</filename> or <filename>VGABIOS-elpin-2.40</filename>)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
at least one bootable media, either as disk image (floppy, hard disk or CD-ROM) or physical disk (floppy or CD-ROM)
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<note><para>
Both VGA BIOS versions as well as the ROM BIOS are part of the Bochs package. No separate download is necessary.
See <xref linkend="rom-images"> for more information.</para></note>

<note><para>
If you want to use the Cirrus SVGA adapter instead of VGA + Bochs VBE, you should
have a look at <xref linkend="cirrus-notes">.
</para></note>

<para>
In that case you have to pass the configuration options on the command
line or to use the configuration interface to set up Bochs for the simulation.
Running Bochs is easier if you use a configuration file (we call it
<filename>bochsrc</filename>). See <xref linkend="bochsrc"> for all supported options.
</para>

<para>
The easiest way to setup Bochs for the first time is to use the example configuration
file called <filename>bochsrc-sample.txt</filename>. Locate that file (location depends
on the (host) OS and on the installation facility used) and copy it to a location where
Bochs looks for that file, see <xref linkend="search-order">.
</para>

<para>
The next step is to change the configuration so that it fits your needs: You most
likely want to setup a hard disk (see <xref linkend="using-bximage"> and
<xref linkend="bochsopt-ata-master-slave">), and install some OS on it using either
a set of floppy disks (see <xref linkend="bochsopt-floppyab">) or a CD-ROM
(see <xref linkend="bochsopt-ata-master-slave"> again) as installation media.
Make sure you boot the emulation from the media you want, using the right setting
as <link linkend="bochsopt-boot">boot option</link>.
</para>

<para>
If your keyboard output inside of Bochs is wrong, you may also need a keymap file
to remap your keyboard layout to the U.S. layout. A set of keymap files for the
X window system and SDL (Linux port) is distributed with Bochs. If your
keyboard layout is not supported yet, you can create your own one by following the
instructions given in <xref linkend="keymap">.
</para>

<para>
A collection of disk images  of different operating systems can be found at
<ulink url="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/diskimages.html"></ulink>. Some disk
images are the size of a floppy disk (1 meg compressed) and others are gigantic
(160 meg compressed). If you want to create a disk image yourself, please see
<xref linkend="diskimagehowto">.
</para>

</section>

<section id="rom-images">
<title>ROM images</title>
<para>
Just like a real PC, Bochs needs a system BIOS and VGA BIOS to initialize the
machine when it powers on or after a hardware reset. Bochs needs to load them
from image file into the emulated memory. The Bochs package contains a set of
system BIOS and VGA BIOS images.

<para>
Bochs must be set up to use system and VGA BIOS like this:
<screen>
  romimage: file=BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xfffe0000
  vgaromimage: file=VGABIOS-lgpl-latest
</screen>
We recommend to use the ROM images distributed with Bochs or one of the latest
<ulink url="http://www.seabios.org/">SeaBIOS</ulink> images. BIOS images designed
for real hardware mostly do not work properly. Please see the <xref linkend="bochsopt-romimage">
for more information.
</para>

<para>
Bochs supports optional ROM images to be loaded into the ISA ROM space,
typically between C8000 and EFFFF (see <xref linkend="bochsopt-optrom">). The PCI
versions of the Bochs network adapter emulations support loading a boot ROM into
the PCI ROM space (see <xref linkend="bochsopt-ne2k">).
</para>

</section>

<section id="bochsrc">
<title>The configuration file <filename>bochsrc</filename></title>
<para>
Bochs uses a configuration file called <filename>bochsrc</filename> to know
where to look for disk images, how the Bochs emulation layer should work, etc.
When you first start up Bochs, it looks around for its configuration file
(see <xref linkend="search-order">), and parses it.
Here are a few lines from a sample file:
<screen>
  ata0-master: type=disk, path="30M.sample", cylinders=615, heads=6, spt=17
  boot: disk
</screen>
The format is very strict, so be sure to put the right number of spaces and
use lowercase letters.  As you can see, most lines have a keyword telling what
is being configured, followed by a colon, followed by a few
<varname>property</varname>=<varname>value</varname> pairs, separated by
commas.  For very simple options, sometimes just a single value is needed.
The source and binary distributions come with a sample
<filename>bochsrc</filename>, so you can just copy the sample file and edit the
settings you need to change.
</para>

<para>
The syntax used for <filename>bochsrc</filename> can also be used as command line arguments for Bochs.
If you have any spaces in your command line arguments, they should be enclosed
in single quotes, for example:
<screen>
  bochs 'boot:floppy' 'floppya: 1_44=a.img, status=inserted'
</screen>
For other arguments, see section <link linkend="commandline">Command line arguments</link>.
</para>

<para>
You can use environment variables with the dollar sign prefix in the
<filename>bochsrc</filename> file, for example:
<screen>
  floppya: 1_44="$IMAGES/bootdisk.img", status=inserted
  boot: floppy
</screen>
There are two environment variables with a built-in default value which is set
at compile or installation time.  $BXSHARE points to the
"share" directory which is typically /usr/local/share/bochs on UNIX
machines.  See the $(sharedir) variable in the Makefile for the exact
value.  $BXSHARE is used in the config files of the Bochs disk images to
locate the directory where the BIOS images and keymaps can be found.
If $BXSHARE is not defined, Bochs will supply the default value.
Also, $LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH points to a list of directories to search in for Bochs
plugins. The paths are separated by colons (on Windows: semicolons).
A compile-time default is provided if this variable is not defined by the user.
On Win32 and MacOSX, the default for the share directory is determined by a
platform-specific specific algorithm. On Win32, we use the registry to see what
directory Bochs and its support files were installed in. On MacOSX, the share
directory is the directory where the application is located.
</para>

<para>
You can use the <command>#include</command> statement in the bochsrc to read the
configuration from other files. Now it is possible to put platform or
installation defaults in a global config file (e.g. location of rom images).
Put this on top of your config file if the global configuration is stored in /etc:
<screen>
 #include /etc/bochsrc
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Bochs now treats unknown options as device plugin names. It tries to load this
plugin and if successful it tries to call the parser function for this configuration
line which is located in the plugin. This mechanism is implemented for the Bochs
network, sound and USB devices. If there is a typo in an option name or an obsolete
option is used, Bochs will panic and exit with a plugin load failure error
message. In that case the failing line in your bochsrc file must be reviewed
and fixed.
</para>

<para>
The section below lists all the supported <filename>bochsrc</filename> options.
</para>

<section id="bochsopt-plugin-ctrl"><title>plugin_ctrl</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  plugin_ctrl: unmapped=0, e1000=1 # unload 'unmapped' and load 'e1000'
</screen>
Controls the presence of optional device plugins. These plugins are loaded
directly with this option and some of them install a config option that is
only available when the plugin device is loaded. The value "1" means to load
the plugin and "0" will unload it (if loaded before).
</para>
<para>
These plugins will be loaded by default (if present): 'biosdev', 'extfpuirq',
'gameport', 'iodebug','parallel', 'serial', 'speaker' and 'unmapped'.
</para>
<para>
These plugins are also supported, but they are usually loaded directly with
their bochsrc option: 'e1000', 'es1370', 'ne2k', 'pcidev', 'pcipnic', 'sb16',
'usb_ehci', 'usb_ohci', 'usb_uhci', 'usb_xhci' and 'voodoo'.
</para>
</section>

<section id="bochsopt-configinterface"><title>config_interface</title>
<para>
The configuration interface is a series of menus or dialog boxes that
allows you to edit all the settings that control Bochs' behavior.
Depending on the platform there are up to 3 choices of configuration
interface: a text mode version called "textconfig" and two graphical versions
called "win32config" and "wx".  The text mode version uses stdin/stdout and
is always compiled in, unless Bochs is compiled for wx only. The choice
"win32config" is only available on win32 and it is the default there.
The choice "wx" is only available when Bochs is compiled with wxWidgets support,
see <xref linkend="compile-wx">. If you do not write a config_interface line,
Bochs will choose a default for you (usually textconfig).
</para>

<note><para>
wxWidgets provides both a configuration interface and a display library.
So if you use the "wx" configuration interface, you must also use
the "wx" display library, see
<link linkend="bochsopt-displaylibrary">display_library option</link>.
</para></note>

<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  config_interface: textconfig
  config_interface: win32config
  config_interface: wx
</screen>
</para>
</section>

<section id="bochsopt-displaylibrary"><title>display_library</title>
<para>
The display library is the code that displays the Bochs VGA screen.  Bochs
has a selection of about 10 different display library implementations for
different platforms.  If you run configure with multiple <option>--with-*</option>
options, the display_library option lets you choose which one you want to run with.
If you do not use a display_library line, Bochs will choose a default for
you.
</para>

<note><para>
wxWidgets provides both a configuration interface and a display library.
So if you use the "wx" display library, you must also use
the "wx" configuration interface, see
<link linkend="bochsopt-configinterface">config_interface option</link>.
</para></note>

<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  display_library: x
  display_library: sdl
</screen>
Some display libraries now support specific options to control their
behaviour. These options are supported by more than one display library:
<screen>
  "gui_debug"   - use GTK debugger gui (sdl, x) / Win32 debugger gui (sdl, sdl2, win32)
  "hideIPS"     - disable IPS output in status bar (rfb, sdl, sdl2, vncsrv, win32, wx, x)
  "nokeyrepeat" - turn off host keyboard repeat (sdl, sdl2, win32, x)
  "timeout"     - time (in seconds) to wait for client (rfb, vncsrv)
</screen>
See the examples below for other currently supported options.
<screen>
  display_library: sdl, options="fullscreen"  # startup in fullscreen mode
  display_library: sdl2, options="fullscreen"  # startup in fullscreen mode

</para>
<para><command>model</command></para>
<para>
Selects CPU configuration to emulate from pre-defined list of all
supported configurations. When this option is used and the value
is different from 'bx_generic', the parameters of the <link linkend="bochsopt-cpuid">CPUID</link>
option have no effect anymore. See the <xref linkend="cpu-models"> for supported values.
</para>
<para><command>count</command></para>
<para>
Set the number of processors:cores per processor:threads per core when Bochs
is compiled for SMP emulation. Bochs currently supports up to 14 threads
(legacy APIC) or 254 threads (xAPIC or higher) running simultaniosly.
If Bochs is compiled without SMP support, it won't accept values
different from 1. For more information on SMP see <xref linkend="SMP">.
</para>
<para><command>quantum</command></para>
<para>
Maximum amount of instructions allowed to execute by processor before
returning control to another cpu. This option exists only in Bochs
binary compiled with SMP support.
</para>
<para><command>reset_on_triple_fault</command></para>
<para>
Reset the CPU when triple fault occur (highly recommended) rather than PANIC.
Remember that if you are trying to continue after triple fault the simulation
will be completely bogus !
</para>
<para><command>cpuid_limit_winnt</command></para>
<para>
Determine whether to limit maximum CPUID function to 2. This mode is required
to workaround WinNT installation and boot issues.
</para>
<para><command>mwait_is_nop</command></para>
<para>
When this option is enabled MWAIT will not put the CPU into a sleep state.
This option exists only if Bochs compiled with <option>--enable-monitor-mwait</option>.
</para>
<para><command>msrs</command></para>
<para>
Define path to user CPU Model Specific Registers (MSRs) specification.
See example in msrs.def.
</para>
<para><command>ignore_bad_msrs</command></para>
<para>
Ignore MSR references that Bochs does not understand; print a warning message
instead of generating #GP exception. This option is enabled by default but 
will not be available if configurable MSRs are enabled.
</para>
<para><anchor id="bochsopt-cpu-ips"><command>ips</command></para>
<para>
Emulated Instructions Per Second.  This is the number of IPS that Bochs is
capable of running on your machine.  You can recompile Bochs with
<option>--enable-show-ips</option> option enabled, to find your workstation's capability.
Measured IPS value will then be logged into your <link linkend="bochsopt-log">log file</link>
or in the status bar (if supported by the gui).
</para>

<para>
IPS is used to calibrate many time-dependent events within the Bochs
simulation.  For example, changing IPS affects the frequency of VGA updates,
the duration of time before a key starts to autorepeat, and the measurement
of BogoMips and other benchmarks.  The table below lists some typical
IPS settings for different machines<footnote><para>IPS measurements depend on
OS and compiler configuration in addition to host processor clock
speed.</para></footnote>.

<section id="bochsopt-memory"><title>memory</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  memory: guest=512, host=256
</screen>
Set the amount of physical memory you want to emulate.
</para>
<para><command>guest</command></para>
<para>
Set amount of guest physical memory to emulate. The default is 32MB,
the maximum amount limited only by physical address space limitations.
</para>
<para><command>host</command></para>
<para>
Set amount of host memory you want to allocate for guest RAM emulation.
It is possible to allocate less memory than you want to emulate in guest
system. This will fake guest to see the non-existing memory. Once guest
system touches new memory block it will be dynamically taken from the
memory pool. You will be warned (by FATAL PANIC) in case guest already
used all allocated host memory and wants more.
</para>
<note><para>
Due to limitations in the host OS, Bochs fails to allocate more than 1024MB on most 32-bit systems.
In order to overcome this problem configure and build Bochs with <option>--enable-large-ramfile</option>
option.
</para></note>
</section>

<section><title>megs</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  megs: 32
  megs: 128
</screen>
This option sets the 'guest' and 'host' memory parameters to the same
value. In all other cases the 'memory' option should be used instead.

<section id="bochsopt-romimage"><title>romimage</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  romimage: file=bios/BIOS-bochs-latest, options=fastboot
  romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-legacy
  romimage: file=mybios.bin, address=0xfff80000
</screen>
The ROM BIOS controls what the PC does when it first powers on.  Normally, you
can use a precompiled BIOS in the source or binary distribution called
<filename>BIOS-bochs-latest</filename>. The default ROM BIOS is usually loaded
starting at address 0xfffe0000, and it is exactly 128k long. The legacy version
of the Bochs BIOS is usually loaded starting at address 0xffff0000, and it is
exactly 64k long.
You can use the environment variable $BXSHARE to specify the location of the BIOS.
The usage of external large BIOS images (up to 512k) at memory top is
now supported, but we still recommend to use the BIOS distributed with Bochs.
The start address is optional, since it can be calculated from image size.
The Bochs BIOS currently supports only the option "fastboot" to skip the
boot menu delay.
</para>

</screen>
This tells Bochs what VGA ROM BIOS to load (at 0xC0000).
</para>
<para>A VGA BIOS from Elpin Systems, Inc. as well as a free LGPL'd VGA BIOS
are provided in the source and binary distributions.</para>

<para>
Example:
<screen>
   optromimage1: file=optionalrom.bin, address=0xd0000
</screen>

This enables Bochs to load up to 4 optional ROM images.
</para>
<para>
Be sure to use a
read-only area, typically between C8000 and EFFFF. These optional
ROM images should not overwrite the rombios (located at
F0000-FFFFF) and the videobios (located at C0000-C7FFF).
</para>
<para>
Those ROM images will be initialized by the BIOS if they contain
the right signature (0x55AA).

<title>vga</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  vga: extension=cirrus, update_freq=10, realtime=1
  vga: extension=vbe
</screen>
This defines parameters related to the VGA display
</para>
<para>
The 'extension' option can be used to specify the VGA display extension.
With the value 'none' you can use standard VGA with no extension. Other supported
values are 'vbe' for Bochs VBE (needs <filename>VGABIOS-lgpl-latest</filename> as
VGA BIOS, see <link linkend="bochsopt-vgaromimage">vgaromimage option</link>),
'cirrus' for Cirrus SVGA support (needs
<filename>VGABIOS-lgpl-latest-cirrus</filename> as VGA BIOS) and
'voodoo' for Voodoo Graphics support (needs external VGA BIOS / see
<xref linkend="voodoo-notes"> for more information).
</para>
<para>
The VGA update frequency specifies the number of display updates per second.
This parameter can be changed at runtime. The default value is 5.
</para>
<para>
The 'realtime' option specifies the operation mode of the VGA update timer.
If set to 1, the VGA timer is based on realtime, otherwise it is based on the
ips setting. If the host is slow (low ips, update_freq) and the guest uses HLT
appropriately, setting this to 0 and "clock: sync=none" may improve the
responsiveness of the guest GUI when the guest is otherwise idle. The default
value is 1.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>voodoo</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  voodoo: enabled=1, model=voodoo1
</screen>
This defines the Voodoo Graphics emulation (experimental). Currently
supported models are 'voodoo1', 'voodoo2', 'banshee' and 'voodoo3'.
The Voodoo2 support is not yet complete, but almost usable. The Banshee /
Voodoo3 support is under construction, but basically usable. The 2D/3D cards
require an external VGA BIOS the vga extension option to be set to 'voodoo'.
If the i440BX PCI chipset is selected, they can be assigned to AGP (slot #5).
The gui screen update timing for all models is controlled by the related
'vga' options. See <xref linkend="voodoo-notes"> for more information.

Defaults to "mf". It should be ok for almost everybody. A known
exception is french macs, that do have a "at"-like keyboard.
</para>
<para><command>serial_delay</command></para>
<para>
Approximate time in microseconds that it takes one character to
be transferred from the keyboard to controller over the serial path.
</para>
<para><command>paste_delay</command></para>
<para>
Approximate time in microseconds between attempts to paste
characters to the keyboard controller. This leaves time for the
guest os to deal with the flow of characters.  The ideal setting
depends on how your operating system processes characters.  The
default of 100000 usec (.1 seconds) was chosen because it works 
consistently in Windows.
</para>
<para>
If your OS is losing characters during a paste, increase the paste
delay until it stops losing characters.
</para>
<para><command>keymap</command></para>
<para>
This enables a remap of a physical localized keyboard to a
virtualized us keyboard, as the PC architecture expects.
</para>
<para>
Keyboard mapping is available for the display libraries x, sdl (Linux port) and
wx (GTK port). For SDL you have to use keymaps designed for SDL, the wxWidgets GUI
uses the keymaps for X11.
</para>
<para><command>user_shortcut</command></para>
<para>

</para>
<para><command>type</command></para>
<para>
With the mouse type option you can select the type of mouse to emulate.
The default value is 'ps2'. The other choices are 'imps2' (wheel mouse
on PS/2), 'serial', 'serial_wheel', 'serial_msys' (one com port requires
setting 'mode=mouse', see <link linkend="bochsopt-com">com option</link>)
'inport' and 'bus' (if present). To connect a mouse to a USB port, see the
<link linkend="bochsopt-usb-uhci">usb_uhci</link>, 'usb_ohci', 'usb_ehci'
or 'usb_xhci' options (requires PCI and USB support).
</para>
<para><command>enabled</command></para>
<para>
The Bochs gui creates mouse "events" unless the 'enabled' option is
set to 0. The hardware emulation itself is not disabled by this.
Unless you have a particular reason for enabling the mouse by default,
it is recommended that you leave it off. You can also toggle the
mouse usage at runtime (see <link linkend="headerbar">headerbar</link>
and the 'toggle' option below).
</para>
<para><command>toggle</command></para>
<para>
The default method to toggle the mouse capture at runtime is to press the
CTRL key and the middle mouse button ('ctrl+mbutton'). This option allows
to change the method to 'ctrl+f10' (like DOSBox) or 'ctrl+alt' (like QEMU)
or 'f12'.

  pci: enabled=1, chipset=i440bx, slot5=voodoo, slot1=e1000
</screen>
This option controls the presence of a PCI chipset in Bochs. Currently it
supports the i430FX, i440FX and i440BX chipsets. You can also specify the
devices connected to PCI slots. Up to 5 slots are available. For these
combined PCI/ISA devices assigning to slot is mandatory if you want to emulate
the PCI model: cirrus, ne2k and pcivga. These PCI-only devices are also
supported, but they are auto-assigned if you don't use the slot configuration:
e1000, es1370, pcidev, pcipnic, usb_ehci, usb_ohci, usb_xhci and voodoo.
In case of the i440BX chipset, slot #5 is the AGP slot. Currently only the
'voodoo' device can be assigned to AGP.

<para>
This defines the parameters of the clock inside Bochs:
</para>
<para><command>sync</command></para>
<para>
This defines the method how to synchronize the Bochs internal time
with realtime. With the value 'none' the Bochs time relies on the IPS
value and no host time synchronization is used. The 'slowdown' method
sacrifices performance to preserve reproducibility while allowing host
time correlation. The 'realtime' method sacrifices reproducibility to
preserve performance and host-time correlation.
It is possible to enable both synchronization methods.
</para>
<para><command>rtc_sync</command></para>
<para>
If this option is enabled together with the realtime synchronization,
the RTC runs at realtime speed. This feature is disabled by default.
</para>
<para><command>time0</command></para>
<para>
Specifies the start (boot) time of the virtual machine. Use a time
value as returned by the time(2) system call or a string as returned
by the ctime(3) system call. If no time0 value is set or if time0
equal to 1 (special case) or if time0 equal 'local', the simulation
will be started at the current local host time. If time0 equal to 2

  floppya: type=1_44
</screen>
Floppya is the first drive, and floppyb is the second drive. If you're booting
from a floppy, floppya should point to a bootable disk.  To read from a disk
image, write the name of the image file.  In many operating systems Bochs can
read directly from a raw floppy drive.  For raw disk access, use the device
name (Unix systems) or the drive letter and a colon (Windows systems).
</para>
<para>
Following floppy media types are supported: 2_88, 1_44, 1_2, 720k, 360k, 320k, 180k,
160k, as well as "image" to let Bochs auto-detect the type of floppy media (does only
work with images, not with raw floppy drives). In that case the size must match
one of the supported types.
</para>
<para>
You can set the initial status of the media to <constant>ejected</constant>
or <constant>inserted</constant>. Usually you will want to use
<constant>inserted</constant>.
</para>
<para>
The parameter 'type' can be used to enable the floppy drive without media
and status specified. Usually the drive type is set up based on the media type.
</para>
<para>
The optional parameter 'write_protected' can be used to control the media
write protect switch. By default it is turned off.

<para>
  You have to tell the type of the attached device. For Bochs 2.0 or later, it can be
  <parameter>disk</parameter> or <parameter>cdrom</parameter>.
</para>

<para>
You have to point the "path" at a hard disk image file, cdrom iso file,
or physical cdrom device.
To create a hard disk image, try running <command>bximage</command> (see
<xref linkend="diskimagehowto">). It will help you choose the size and
then suggest a line that works with it.
</para>

<para>
In Unix it is possible to use a raw device as a Bochs hard disk,
but <emphasis>we don't recommend it</emphasis> for safety reasons. In Windows, there is no easy way.
</para>

<para>
Disk geometry autodetection works with images created by bximage if CHS is set
to 0/0/0 (cylinders are calculated using  heads=16 and spt=63). For other hard
disk images and modes the cylinders, heads, and spt are mandatory. In all cases
the disk size reported from the image must be exactly C*H*S*512. Flat hard disk
images from other projects might store additional information at the end of the
file that makes this check fail. Only in this case it is safe to select "continue"
when Bochs panics.

<section id="bochsopt-debug-info-error-panic"><title>debug/info/error/panic</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  debug: action=ignore, pci=report
  info: action=report
  error: action=report
  panic: action=ask
</screen>

During simulation, Bochs encounters certain events that the user might want to
know about.  These events are divided into four levels of importance: debug,
info, error, and panic.  Debug messages are usually only useful when writing
Bochs code or when trying to locate a problem.  There may be thousands of debug
messages per second, so be careful before turning them on.  Info messages tell
about interesting events that don't happen that frequently.  Bochs produces an
"error" message when it  finds a condition that really shouldn't happen,  but
doesn't endanger the simulation.  An example of an error  might be  if the
emulated  software produces an illegal disk command.  Panic messages mean that
Bochs cannot simulate correctly and should probably shut down.
A panic can be a configuration problem (like a misspelled bochsrc line) or an
emulation problem (like an unsupported video mode).
</para>

<para>
The debug, info, error, and panic lines in the bochsrc control what Bochs will
do when it encounters each type of event.  The allowed actions are: fatal
(terminate bochs), ask (ask the user what to do), warn (show dialog with message
and continue), report (print information to the console or log file), or ignore
(do nothing). The recommended settings are listed in the sample above.
</para>

<para>
It is also possible to specify the 'action' to do for each Bochs facility
separately (e.g. crash on panics from everything except the cdrom, and only
report those). See the <link linkend="logopts-by-device">log function module table</link>
for valid module names.
</para>

<tip>
<para>
The safest action for panics is "fatal" or "ask".  If you are getting lots of
panics and get tired of telling it to continue each time, you can try
action=report instead.  If you allow Bochs to continue after a panic, don't
be surprised if you get strange behavior or crashes after a panic occurs.
Please report panic messages to the &devlist; unless it is just a configuration
problem like "could not find hard drive image."

  com4: enabled=1, mode=pipe-client, dev=\\.\pipe\mypipe
  com4: enabled=1, mode=pipe-server, dev=\\.\pipe\mypipe
</screen>
  This defines a serial port (UART type 16550A).
</para>
<para>
  When using the mode 'term', you can specify a device to use as com1.
  This can be a real serial line, or a pty.  To use a pty (under X/Unix),
  create two windows (xterms, usually).  One of them will run Bochs, and
  the other will act as com1. Find out the tty of the com1 window using
  the `tty' command, and use that as the `dev' parameter.  Then do
  `sleep 1000000' in the com1 window to keep the shell from messing with
  things, and run Bochs in the other window. Serial I/O to com1 (port 0x3f8)
  will all go to the other window.
</para>
<para>
  When using socket* and pipe* (win32 only) modes Bochs becomes either
  socket/named pipe client or server. In client mode it connects to an already
  running server (if connection fails Bochs treats com port as not connected).
  In server mode it opens socket/named pipe and waits until a client application
  connects to it before starting simulation. This mode is useful for remote
  debugging (e.g. with gdb's "target remote host:port" command or windbg's command
  line option -k com:pipe,port=\\.\pipe\pipename). Socket modes use simple TCP
  communication, pipe modes use duplex byte mode pipes.
</para>
<para>
  Other serial modes are 'null' (no input/output), 'file' (output to a file
  specified as the 'dev' parameter and changeable at runtime), 'raw' (use the
  real serial port - partly implemented on win32), 'mouse' (standard serial
  mouse - requires <link linkend="bochsopt-mouse">mouse option</link> setting
  'type=serial', 'type=serial_wheel' or 'type=serial_msys').

  parport1: enabled=0
</screen>
This defines a parallel (printer) port. When turned on and an output file is
defined, the emulated printer port sends characters printed by the guest OS
into the output file. On some platforms, a device filename can be used to
send the data to the real parallel port (e.g. "/dev/lp0" on Linux, "lpt1" on
win32 platforms). The output file can be changed at runtime.

IOADDR, IRQ: You probably won't need to change ioaddr and irq, unless there
are IRQ conflicts. These parameters are ignored if the NE2000 is assigned to
a PCI slot.

MAC: The MAC address MUST NOT match the address of any machine on the net.
Also, the first byte must be an even number (bit 0 set means a multicast
address), and you cannot use ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff because that's the broadcast
address.  For the ethertap module, you must use fe:fd:00:00:00:01.  There may
be other restrictions too.  To be safe, just use the b0:c4... address.

ETHMOD: The ethmod value defines which low level OS specific module to be
used to access physical ethernet interface. You can also specify a network
simulator or a module with no input/output ("null"). See the table below for
currently supported values.

ETHDEV: The ethdev value is the name of the network interface on your host
platform.  On UNIX machines, you can get the name by running ifconfig.  On
Windows machines, you must run niclist to get the name of the ethdev.
Niclist source code is in misc/niclist.c and it is included in Windows
binary releases.

SCRIPT: The script value is optional, and is the name of a script that
is executed after bochs initialize the network interface. You can use
this script to configure this network interface, or enable masquerading.
This is mainly useful for the tun/tap devices that only exist during
Bochs execution. The network interface name is supplied to the script
as first parameter.

BOOTROM: The bootrom value is optional, and is the name of the ROM image
to load. Note that this feature is only implemented for the PCI version of
the NE2000.

<section id="bochsopt-usb-uhci"><title>usb_uhci</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  usb_uhci: enabled=1, port1=mouse, port2=disk:usbstick.img
  usb_uhci: enabled=1, port1=hub:7, port2=disk:growing:usbdisk.img
  usb_uhci: enabled=1, port2=disk:undoable:usbdisk.img, options2=journal:redo.log

  usb_uhci: enabled=1, port1=printer:printdata.bin, port2=cdrom:image.iso
  usb_uhci: enabled=1, port2=floppy:vvfat:diskette, options2="model:teac"
</screen>
This option controls the presence of the USB root hub which is a part of the
i440FX PCI chipset.
</para>
<para>
With the port<replaceable>X</replaceable> option you can connect devices
to the hub (currently supported: 'mouse', 'tablet', 'keypad', 'disk', 'cdrom',
'floppy, ''hub' and 'printer').
</para>
<para>
If you connect the mouse or tablet to one of the ports, Bochs forwards the
mouse movement data to the USB device instead of the selected mouse type.
When connecting the keypad to one of the ports, Bochs forwards the input of
the numeric keypad to the USB device instead of the PS/2 keyboard.
</para>
<para>
To connect a 'flat' mode image as a USB hardisk you can use the 'disk' device
with the path to the image separated with a colon. To use other disk image modes
similar to ATA disks the syntax 'disk:mode:filename' must be used (see above).
</para>
<para>
To emulate a USB cdrom you can use the 'cdrom' device name and the path to
an ISO image or raw device name also separated with a colon. An option to
insert/eject media is available in the runtime configuration.
</para>
<para>
To emulate a USB floppy you can use the 'floppy' device with the path to the
image separated with a colon. To use the VVFAT image mode similar to the
legacy floppy the syntax 'floppy:vvfat:directory' must be used (see above).
An option to insert/eject media is available in the runtime configuration.
</para>
<para>
The device name 'hub' connects an external hub with max. 8 ports (default: 4)
to the root hub. To specify the number of ports you have to add the value
separated with a colon. Connecting devices to the external hub ports is only
available in the runtime configuration.
</para>
<para>
The device 'printer' emulates the HP Deskjet 920C printer. The PCL data is
sent to a file specified in bochsrc.txt. The current code appends the PCL
code to the file if the file already existed. The output file can be changed
at runtime.
</para>
<para>
The options<replaceable>X</replaceable> parameter can be used to assign specific
options to the device connected to the corresponding USB port. Currently this
feature is used to set the speed reported by device ('low', 'full', 'high' or
'super'). The available speed choices depend on both HC and device. The option
'debug' turns on debug output for the device at connection time. For the USB
'disk' device the optionsX parameter can be used to specify an alternative
redolog file (journal) of some image modes. For 'vvfat' mode USB disks the optionsX
parameter can be used to specify the disk size (range 128M ... 128G). If the
size is not specified, it defaults to 504M.
For the USB 'floppy' device the optionsX parameter can be used to specify an
alternative device ID to be reported. Currently only the model "teac" is
supported (can fix hw detection in some guest OS). The USB floppy also
accepts the parameter "write_protected" with valid values 0 and 1 to select
the access mode (default is 0).

<para>
Example:
<screen>
  usb_ohci: enabled=1, port1=printer:printdata.bin
</screen>
This option controls the presence of the USB OHCI host controller with a
2-port hub. The portX parameter accepts the same device types with the same
syntax as the UHCI controller (see the <link linkend="bochsopt-usb-uhci">usb_uhci option</link>).
The optionsX parameter is also available on OHCI.</para>

<para>
Example:
<screen>
  usb_ehci: enabled=1, port1=tablet, options1="speed:high"
</screen>
This option controls the presence of the USB EHCI host controller with a
6-port hub. The portX parameter accepts the same device types with the same
syntax as the UHCI controller (see the <link linkend="bochsopt-usb-uhci">usb_uhci option</link>).
The optionsX parameter is also available on EHCI.</para>

<section id="bochsopt-usb-xhci"><title>usb_xhci</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  usb_xhci: enabled=1, port1="disk:usbdisk.img"

This option controls the presence of the USB xHCI host controller with a 4-port
hub. The portX parameter accepts the same device types with the same syntax as
the UHCI controller (see the <link linkend="bochsopt-usb-uhci">usb_uhci option</link>).
The optionsX parameter is also available on xHCI. NOTE: port 1 and 2 are USB3 and
only support super-speed devices, but port 3 and 4 are USB2 and support speed
settings low, full and high.</para>
</section>

<section><title>pcidev</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  pcidev: vendor=0xbabe, device=0x2bad
</screen>
Enables the mapping of a host PCI hardware device within the virtual PCI
subsystem of the Bochs x86 emulator. The arguments
<varname>vendor</varname> and <varname>device</varname>
should contain the PCI vendor ID respectively the PCI
device ID of the host PCI device you want to map within Bochs.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The PCI device mapping is still in a very early stage of development and thus it is very experimental.
This feature requires Linux as a host operating system.
</para>
</note>
<para>
Besides the <varname>pcidev</varname> config line you will need to load
a pcidev kernel module within your Linux host OS. This kernel module is
located in the <constant>bochs/host/linux/pcidev/</constant> directory.

<section><title>magic_break</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  magic_break: enabled=1

<para>
Example:
<screen>
  debug_symbols: file=mysymbols.sym
  debug_symbols: file=mysymbols.sym, offset=0x1000
</screen>
This loads symbols from the specified file for use in Bochs' internal debugger.
Symbols are loaded into global context. This is equivalent to issuing ldsym
debugger command at start up.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>port_e9_hack</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  port_e9_hack: enabled=1
</screen>
The 0xE9 port doesn't exists in normal ISA architecture. However, we
define a convention here, to display on the console of the system running
Bochs anything that is written to it. The idea is to provide debug output
very early when writing BIOS or OS code for example, without having to
bother with setting up a serial port or etc. Reading from port 0xE9 will
will return 0xe9 to let you know if the feature is available. Leave  
this 0 unless you have a reason to use it.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>user_plugin</title>
<para>
Example:
<screen>
  user_plugin: name=testdev

<section id="keymap"><title>How to write your own keymap table</title>
<para>
Christophe Bothamy wrote the keymapping code for Bochs, and provided this
documentation for how to create new keymaps.  Keymapping was first
implemented for X windows only, so there are many references to X-specific
values in this section. In Bochs 2.0 keymapping is also available for SDL
(Linux port) and wxWidgets (wxGTK port).
</para>
<screen>
  The standard US Keyboard looks like this:

          -------------------------------------------
  Top row Esc F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12
          -------------------------------------------
  2nd row ` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = \ Back
          -------------------------------------------
  3rd row Tab Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] Enter
          -------------------------------------------
  4rd row Caps A S D F G H J K L ; '
          -------------------------------------------
  5rd row lShift l\ Z X C V B N M , . / rShift
          -------------------------------------------
  6rd row lCtrl lAlt Space rAlt rCtrl
          -------------------------------------------
</screen>

<para>
Each key of the US keyboard maps to a Bochs constant named
BX_KEY_<replaceable>symbol</replaceable>. You can find the current list of
BX_KEY_<replaceable>symbol</replaceable> in
<link linkend="bx-key-table">the BX_KEY table</link>, below. Please note that
there is only one BX_KEY_<replaceable>symbol</replaceable> for each physical
key.
</para>

<para>
Now, for each key of the US keyboard, look at which symbols you can type on your
real keyboard. Each symbol maps to a X-windows
XK_<replaceable>symbol</replaceable> constant.  In
<filename>X11/keysymdef.h</filename>, you will find the list of all possible
XK_<replaceable>symbol</replaceable> on your system.  Alternatively, you can
use a small utility called "xev" that prints out the symbol names of a pressed
key. Note that the symbol name given by xev does not contain the XK_ prefix.
Don't forget to add a line for every symbol you can type on each key.  For the
key BX_KEY_A, you can type both lowercase 'a' and uppercase 'A', so you would
need two different entries.
</para>

<para>
You can then create your own map file. Keymap files are found in the
"gui/keymaps" directory in the source code, or in the "keymaps" directory in
binary releases.  Look at the existing keymap file as an example, and create a
file containing one line for each symbol.  The first column tells what key or
combination of keys can be used to produce a given symbol.  The second column
is the ASCII equivalent for that symbol, or a special keyword (none, space,
return, tab, backslash, or apostrophe).  The third column is the X windows
keysym for that symbol.
</para>

</screen>
</para>

<para>
Now that there are several keymap files in the Bochs distribution, it is
easiest to copy an existing keymap and follow the examples you see.  When it
works, be sure to send it to the mailing list or post it on Source Forge so
that we can include it in the next release.  You may need to look up some of
your country specific X11 symbols in <filename>X11/keysymdef.h</filename>.

<chapter id="using-bochs"><title>Using Bochs</title>
<para>
After starting Bochs either from the command prompt or the OS shell, the following
steps are done before the simulation is running.
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>parse <link linkend="commandline">command line</link> (except bochsrc options)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>enter the simulation loop</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
<para>
During simulation, Bochs usually generates more or less log output. By default it
is sent to the console, otherwise to the specified <link linkend="bochsopt-log">log file</link>.
The amount of output can be controlled with the <link linkend="bochsopt-debug-info-error-panic">log options</link>
in bochsrc, the start menu and the runtime configuration.
</para>
<para>
Under certain conditions Bochs can cause a <link linkend="logevent-panic">panic</link>
and usually asks the user what to do. If such a panic happens during startup, it is
mostly a configuration or permission problem and we recommend to quit Bochs and to
review the bochsrc options used.
</para>
<para>
To quit the simulation, the "power" button in the Bochs <link linkend="headerbar">headerbar</link>
should be used, unless the guest OS has the capability to turn off the computer (APM or ACPI).
</para>
<para>
If a Bochs runtime issue cannot be fixed by configuration changes and it has not yet
been reported in the &devlist; or the SF trackers for Bochs, it should be reported in
the mailing list or the <link linkend="sf-trackers">SF bug tracker</link> for the Bochs project.
</para>

<section id="commandline"><title>Command line arguments</title>

<para>
These arguments are handled directly after starting Bochs. The next step is to load
a default or specified configuration file (unless disabled with -n). Then the rest
of the command line (<filename>bochsrc</filename> options) is parsed. This is done after reading the
configuration file so that the command line arguments can override the settings
from the file.
</para>
</section>

<section id="search-order"><title>Search order for the configuration file</title>
<para>
If no configuration file is specified on the command line and config file loading
is not disabled, Bochs searches for a default configuration file. This is the search order:

<section id="textconfig"><title>The configuration interface 'textconfig'</title>
<para>
The configuration interface 'textconfig' is the text mode version of the Bochs
configuration system. It is a series of menus (using stdin/stdout) that allows
you to edit all the settings that control Bochs' behavior. If you do not write
a config_interface line, Bochs will choose it as the default for you (unless Bochs
is compiled for Win32 or wxWidgets only).
</para>
<para>
It consists of these three parts:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the start menu</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the headerbar buttons</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the runtime configuration</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
On Win32 (without wxWidgets) the default configuration interface 'win32config' is
very similar, but it presents gui dialogs instead of text menus.
</para>
<section><title>The start menu</title>
<para>
If you start Bochs without the quickstart argument (-q), the Bochs configuration
main menu appears:
<screen>
------------------------------
Bochs Configuration: Main Menu
------------------------------

This is the Bochs Configuration Interface, where you can describe the
machine that you want to simulate.  Bochs has already searched for a
configuration file (typically called bochsrc.txt) and loaded it if it
could be found.  When you are satisfied with the configuration, go
ahead and start the simulation.

You can also start bochs with the -q option to skip these menus.

1. Restore factory default configuration
2. Read options from...
3. Edit options
4. Save options to...
5. Restore the Bochs state from...
6. Begin simulation
7. Quit now

Please choose one: [5]
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Here you can load, edit and save the configuration and finally start the simulation.
It is possible to start Bochs without a config file and to edit all the settings using
the item "Edit options". Don't forget to save the configuration if you want to use this
setup for another Bochs session.
</para>

behavoiur of Bochs at runtime if you click on one of these buttons:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>floppy buttons</para>
<para>
  Here you can toggle the status of the floppy media (inserted/ejected). Bochs for
  win32 presents you a small dialog box for changing the floppy image. You can

  CD-ROM drives can be set up using <link linkend="bochsopt-ata-master-slave">ata(0-3)-master/-slave option</link>.
  On some platforms this button brings a up a small dialog box for changing the
  CD-ROM image.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>mouse button</para>
<para>
  Here you can enable the creation of mouse events by the host. Once mouse
  events are captured, you cannot reach the button anymore, in order to disable
  capturing again. By default you can enable and disable the mouse capture pressing
  the CTRL key and the third (middle) mouse button. See the <link linkend="bochsopt-mouse">mouse option</link>
  parameter 'toggle' for other methods to toggle the mouse capture.
</para>
<note><para>
  Changing the mouse capture at runtime is not supported by all display libraries,
  but it is already present on RFB, SDL, SDL2, VNCSRV, Win32, wxWidgets and X11.

<section id="cpu-models"><title>Pre-defined CPU models</title>
<para>
If Bochs is compiled with cpu level 5 or higher the CPUID opcode is supported
and it can return some information about the cpu model and it's features. When
using a pre-defined CPU model in Bochs the features reported by CPUID are set up
according to the model's specification. The following table shows all available
CPU models with a short description. The amount of choices depends on the CPU
features enabled at compile time (3rd column).

<section id="using-save-restore"><title>Save and restore simulation</title>
<para>
Bochs has now full save/restore support. The state of cpu(s), memory, devices and
hard drive images
<footnote><para>
The disk image mode "vvfat" does not support save/restore. All other disk image modes
copy the whole image or the file containing changes (journal). This may take some time,
so be patient when using this feature.
</para></footnote>
can be saved. When running Bochs there will be a button in the
header bar called "Suspend". Depending on config interface and gui there will be a
prompt where you can enter a path to an existing directory or a gui folder selection
dialog box. It is possible to save the state at any time, but we recommend to do it
when the simulation is idle. After pressing OK/Enter, Bochs will save a set of files
into the selected folder. It is possible to continue after saving the state, but when
using the restore function in a new Bochs session, all changes after this checkpoint
will be lost.
</para>
<para>
To restore the saved simulation state you can select the restore function in the
text mode start menu or specify the restore path at the command line:
<screen>
bochs -r /path/to/save-restore-data
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Then Bochs will start up using the saved configuration and log options, restores
the state of the hardware and begins the simulation. In the restore mode Bochs
will ignore bochsrc options from the command line and does not load a normal
config file.
</para>

Bochs supports two types of soundcards (SB16 ISA and ES1370 PCI) and the legacy
PC speaker. The lowlevel sound interface provides a set of functions for wave
(PCM) input / output and MIDI output using the host sound system. A driver must
not implement all of these functions. The following table shows the supported
drivers and their features.

When compiling Bochs, the lowlevel sound support is activated if one of the soundcards
is enabled (<option>--enable-sb16</option> or <option>--enable-es1370</option>).
The configure script detects the available drivers and sets up a platform-default
one.
</para>
<para>
At runtime the lowlevel sound module will be loaded automatically if one of the
sound devices is enabled in the <filename>bochsrc</filename>. The drivers and
devices for wave input / output and MIDI output must be set up with the

</para>
</section>
<section><title>The PC speaker</title>
<para>
The PC speaker is connected to the PIT 8254 timer #2 and generates a square
wave beep with a frequency depending on the timer value. In Bochs the
speaker is a separate plugin that is controlled by the two events "beep on"
and "beep off". The "beep on" event is also called when the frequency
changes while turned on.
</para>
<para>
The destination for the speaker output can be selected with the <option>mode</option>
parameter of the <link linkend="bochsopt-speaker">speaker</link> option. Three choices are available:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><option>sound</option> : the beep is generated by the square wave
generator which is a part of the lowlevel sound support.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>system</option> : only available on Linux and Windows.
On Linux /dev/console is used for output and on Windows the Beep() function.</para></listitem>

<section><title>SB16 runtime configuration</title>
<para>
Most of the SB16 configuration parameters are available in the runtime
configuration menu or dialog. In addition to this, there is a small program
called <command>SB16CTRL</command> to change emulation settings from inside
the simulation.
</para>
<section><title>Runtime options</title>
<para>
Unlike other devices, the SB16 emulation has it's own logfile and a loglevel parameter
to control what should be printed there. Both the <option>log</option> file and
<option>loglevel</option> parameters can be changed at runtime. See the
<link linkend="bochsopt-sb16">sb16</link> bochsrc option for details.
</para>
<para>
The output parameters <option>midimode</option>, <option>midifile</option>,
<option>wavemode</option> and <option>wavefile</option> are also available at
runtime.
</para>
<para>
The <option>dmatimer</option> parameter controls the DMA timing for wave (PCM)
input and output. When you get non-continuous sound this value can be ajusted
to fix this. This needs a reasonably correct setting for the
<link linkend="bochsopt-cpu-ips">cpu: ips</link> option.
</para>
</section>
<section id="sb16ctrl"><title>SB16CTRL</title>

<para>
The source for the SB16CTRL program that is used to modify
the runtime behavior of the SB16 emulation is included in

  <section id="logevent-panic">
    <title>Bochs panics! What can I do?</title>
    <para>
      Bochs does a very good job in emulating an x86 compatible computer, however,
      it does not (yet) include a full (100%) emulation of every possible instruction,
      (BIOS) function call or (hardware) device. Thus, in case something unusual
      happens, either a not-so-common call to some (BIOS) function or device by
      some software running inside of it, Bochs has two possibilities to react:
      If the command doesn't look important (mainly happens only to non-implemented
      functions in the BIOS), a notice is logged to the <link linkend="bochsopt-log">log file</link>
      and the emulation continues. If, however, the command looks important, Bochs
      panics, because the software being emulated might depend on the successful
      execution of the given instruction or behavior of the device.
    </para>
    <para>
      A panic does not always mean that the software won't run inside of Bochs,
      as the software might just be probing the computer for the presence of some
      instruction/device, and in case it is not found, it simply won't be used at
      all, by the software.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can tell Bochs what to do in case of a panic, by re-configuring the
      <link linkend="bochsopt-debug-info-error-panic">panic option</link>. If
      you change the action to "ask", Bochs reports what has happened and asks
      you what to do. The appearance of the "ask" feature depends on the display
      library used and the platform. Some display libraries don't support it at all.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some of the device names reported in the panic message are abbreviations,
      since the length of the 'prefix' is limited to 6 characters. The
      <link linkend="logopts-by-device">log function module table</link> may help
      you finding out the name of the device that caused the panic. It also gives
      you a short description of the module.

    <para>
      Refer to <xref linkend="headerbar"> for information on how to enable or
      disable the mouse inside of Bochs at run-time.
    </para>
    <para>
      The mouse cursor movement speed mostly doesn't match the real movement. This
      is caused by the variable emulation speed (from the user's point of view)
      and the relative mouse position data that standard PS/2, serial or USB mice
      are generating. The alternative is the USB tablet emulation that generates
      absolute mouse position data. We recommend to use it with the display
      libraries 'rfb' and 'vncsrv'.

<section id="bochs-developers"><title>bochs-developers mailing list</title>
<para>
Bochs-developers is the forum for all Bochs discussions and questions.  On
average, subscribers get between five and ten messages per day.  There are
about 350 subscribers.  If this sounds like too much email, maybe the <link
linkend="bochs-announce">bochs-announce list</link> is more appropriate for
you.  Anyone may join the list, unless they abuse it of course.

<para>
Bochs-announce is a moderated, low-traffic list which carries only periodic
announcements of Bochs releases and important events.  If you have a very
important and truly relevant Bochs announcement, you can try posting it to
bochs-announce, but the moderator will have to approve it before it will
go out.  On average, bochs-announce subscribers get one or two messages
per month.  There are about 75 subscribers.  Anyone may join the list.

To subscribe, go to the <ulink url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bochs-announce">Bochs-Announce Info Page</ulink> and type your email
address and a password into the web form and click <command>Subscribe</command>.
In a few minutes you will get a confirmation email.  Follow the directions in

<para>
Here are a few guidelines for use of the Bochs mailing lists:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem> <para>
Please check the documentation before asking questions, but on this list you
are very UNLIKELY to get flamed and insulted for being a Bochs beginner.
Sending commercial promotions to the list probably will get you some angry
responses though.
</para> </listitem>

<listitem><para>
If you are having difficulty finding what you are looking for, try doing a search on <ulink url="http://www.google.com">Google</ulink>.  If you are searching for Bochs options, for example, you can use this syntax in the Google search box:
<programlisting>
configuration options site:bochs.sourceforge.net
</programlisting>
For best results, be sure not to put a space between "site:" and "bochs.sourceforge.net".  Be sure to look at more than the first item on the search results.
</para></listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If you still cannot find what you are looking for, be sure you are prepared when you post your question, and post in the right forum.  Be sure you include important details, such as the operating system and version of your host, and what it is you are trying to do.   If you are getting errors or something is not working, summarize what you checked and what you changed.  This will help isolate the problem.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Bochs is for everyone.  If you are an experienced Bochs user or developer and are helping someone else, be considerate of the other person's feelings.  We share a common interest, and we need to encourage each other and be supportive.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem> <para>
Also, keep in mind that messages are limited to 40K, so if you want to share a
large screen shot or disk image, put it on a web or FTP site and tell people
how to find it.  Patches are usually small enough that they aren't a problem,
especially if compressed.
</para> </listitem>

<listitem> <para>
Distribution of copyrighted material, or even offers to distribute copyrighted
material WILL NOT be tolerated.  The Bochs Project does not distribute
any software (disk images) in violation of the license agreement, and users who
do so will be warned first and then blocked from the list if it happens again.
As an open source project, we rely on donated services from Source Forge and
other groups, and we can't afford to put them or ourselves at risk of legal
action.
</para> </listitem>

<listitem> <para>
It is possible to subscribe and unsubscribe by email.  If you do this, you must
write to bochs-announce-request or bochs-developers-request.  Don't forget the
"-request" part or your subscribe message will go to 300+ people.

<para>
This table shows the name used for setting up the log actions per device, the
prefix that appears in the log file or when a panic occurs and a short description

The names can be used in upper case or lower case, since the check is not case
sensitive. Note that the module names cannot be checked while reading the config
file, since most of the modules do not exist at this point. Invalid names or names
of modules not present in the current configuration will cause a panic when the
simulation is starting.

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<section><title>
Create a flat image
</title>

<para>
Option 1: Using the Unix <command>dd</command> utility:
</para>

<para>
You will need to know the geometry of the disk you want to
create. You have to compute the disk sector count:

<screen>
Sectors = Cylinders * Heads * SectorsPerTrack
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Use the dd command to create your file:

<screen>
dd if=/dev/zero of=teaching.img bs=512 count=<replaceable>sectors</replaceable>
</screen>
(replace "sectors" with the number you computed at the
previous step).
</para>

<para>
When you'll update your configuration file, please
fill in the same cylinders, heads and sector per
track values.
</para>


<para>
Option 2: Run <command>bximage</command> to create a disk image file.
You will be greeted with the following prompt:

<screen>
========================================================================
                                bximage
  Disk Image Creation / Conversion / Resize and Commit Tool for Bochs
         $ID: bximage.cc 11906 2013-10-23 08:35:21Z vruppert $
========================================================================

1. Create new floppy or hard disk image
2. Convert hard disk image to other format (mode)
3. Resize hard disk image
4. Commit 'undoable' redolog to base image

0. Quit

Please choose one [0]
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Since we want to create a new image, we have to type '1'
and then <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
<screen>
Do you want to create a floppy disk image or a hard disk image?
Please type hd or fd. [hd]
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Since we are creating a hard disk image, accept the default of hd by
pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> or typing 'hd' and pressing
<keycap>Enter</keycap>. Next, bximage will ask for the type of
hd to create:

<screen>
What kind of image should I create?
Please type flat, sparse, growing or vpc. [flat]
</screen>
</para>


<para>
We want to create a simple flat image, so accept the default
by pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>. Then, bximage will ask
for the size of the disk image you want to create, in Megabytes:

<screen>
Enter the hard disk size in megabytes, between 1 and 8257535
[10]
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Enter the size of the hard disk you want to create, and press
<keycap>Enter</keycap>. Then bximage will ask you for a filename to use
for the file it is creating.
<screen>
What should be the name of the image?
[c.img]
</screen>
</para>

<para>
At this point, type in the filename you want to use for the image.  The
default of "c.img" is appropriate if this will be your only hard disk
image.  After you have typed in the name of the filename you want to
use, press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  Bximage will tell you it is writing the disk
and then it will show you a line that should be added to your
<filename>bochsrc</filename> when you want to use this disk image. I named my
10 Megabyte image "teaching.img" and the output of bximage looked like
this:

<screen>
[c.img] teaching.img

Creating hard disk image 'c.img' with CHS=20/16/63
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The following line should appear in your <filename>bochsrc</filename>:
<screen>
  <link linkend="bochsopt-ata-master-slave">ata0-master</link>: type=disk, path="teaching.img", mode=flat, cylinders=20, heads=16, spt=63
</screen>
</para>

<para>
At this point, a file called "teaching.img" was created in my current
directory and is ready to be used as an image file for a Bochs session.
</para>

<tip>
<para>
You may want to name your image <filename>teaching_20-16-63.img</filename>
so that you always know the values to use for CHS.
</para>
</tip>
</section>

<section>
<title>
Partition and format your image file
</title>

<para>
Option 1: Using FreeDOS (Advantage: Creates a MBR on the partition.)
</para>

<para>
First, you need to edit the <filename>bochsrc</filename> file that Bochs uses for
configuration information (see <xref linkend="search-order">). Open <filename>bochsrc</filename>
with a text editor. Remove all lines in the file which start with "ata0-master:". Add the "ata0-master:"
line that was displayed when you ran bximage to <filename>bochsrc</filename> at the
same place where you removed the old "ata0-master:" lines from.
</para>

<para>
Also, you need to download or create a FreeDOS (or DOS, or Windows, or
Linux) disk image. Modify the "floppya:" line in your <filename>bochsrc</filename> to point
at the downloaded FreeDOS floppy image and change its status to "status=inserted".
</para>

<para>
Save and close your <filename>bochsrc</filename>. Now run Bochs (see <xref linkend="using-bochs">).
</para>

<para>
Use the standard FreeDOS commands <command>fdisk</command> and
<command>format</command> to format your hard
drive image. You must make the image bootable to be able to boot
without a floppy disk. However, creating a bootable disk image is best
done with a boot disk from the OS you intend to install on the image.
</para>


<para>
Option 2: Using mtools (Disadvantage: Cannot create bootable images
without a MBR image.)
</para>

<para>
Use a text editor to add the following line to the file <filename>~/.mtoolsrc</filename>:
</para>


<screen>
drive c: file="<replaceable>path</replaceable>/filename.img" partition=1
</screen>


<para>
Save and close <filename>.mtoolsrc</filename>. Next, execute the following commands to
create a partition table for the drive image:
</para>


<screen>
mpartition -I -s <replaceable>spt</replaceable> -t <replaceable>cyl</replaceable> -h <replaceable>heads</replaceable> c:
mpartition -cpv -s <replaceable>spt</replaceable> -t <replaceable>cyl</replaceable> -h <replaceable>heads</replaceable> c:
</screen>

<para>
For example, for my 10 meg drive, I used:
<screen>
mpartition -I -s 63 -t 20 -h 16 c:
mpartition -cpv -s 63 -t 20 -h 16 c:
</screen>
</para>


<para>
Next, format the partition you just created using the mformat command:

<screen>
mformat c:
</screen>
</para>


<para>
And you now have a formatted disk image containing a single DOS
partition.
</para>
<note><para>
The mpartition command doesn't handle images larger than 1024 cylinders properly.
The partition size reported by fdisk is okay, but mformat reports only 504 MB
(tested with mtools 3.9.9).

<section id="xcolormap"><title>X Windows: Color allocation problems</title>
<para>
One common problem in X windows is that the screen colors can be abnormal
if other X programs have already allocated all the colors.  If the colors
don't look right, try quitting colorful applications such as Netscape,
clearing any complex images in the background, etc. so that Bochs has a
chance to allocate the colors it needs.
</para>
<para>
If Bochs continues to have problems, or you want Bochs to have perfect
colors without having to quit any other application, you can try turning
on the <link linkend="bochsopt-private-colormap">private_colormap option</link>
in the configuration file.  Using a private
colormap causes the Bochs window to have its own set of 256 colors to work
with.  When the cursor is over the Bochs display, Bochs will look correct
and other parts of the screen may change to very strange colors.  When the
cursor goes to any other window, the other windows will look correct
and Bochs will have strange colors.  A better solution, if your hardware
can support it, is to run your X server with 24-bit or 32-bit color.
</para>
</section>

<section id="screensaver"><title>Screen saver turns on too quickly</title>

<para>
One thing you may notice is that the screen saver turns on (screen goes
blank) very quickly after you have stopped typing.  The reason is that Bochs
simulates everything as fast as it can.  If the CPU is very busy (running
instructions nonstop), simulated time goes by slowly.  If the CPU is idle (just
waiting for you to type, for example), simulated time speeds up dramatically.
In any case, if the screen saver blanks out the screen, just press a key (try
shift or control) to restore the screen.
</para>

<para>
There are two strategies to fix this problem.  One is to increase the
<command>ips</command> parameter of the <link linkend="bochsopt-cpu-ips">cpu option</link>
in your configuration file. This will cause the simulation time
to pass more slowly.  The other strategy is to enable the experimental
realtime PIT, which tries to keep Bochs in sync with real time. See the <filename>bochsrc</filename>
option <link linkend="bochsopt-clock">clock</link>.
</para>

<section id="loop-device-usage"><title>Mounting a disk image using the loop device</title>

<para>
This section describes how to access a floppy or hard disk image within Linux
using the loop device. Why would you want to do this?  Let's say you have made
a small Linux disk image for Bochs, and you want to install some more software
on it. You have already downloaded the software onto your real system, so now
you want to transfer it to the Bochs disk image.  A fast way to transfer
the files is to mount the disk image using the loop device.
</para>

<section><title>...on Linux</title>

<para>
This section was contributed by Volker Ruppert.
<screen>
Today I have made some tests with the loop device, because I want to exchange
files with the bochs disk images.  This is what I found out:

1.  Using Floppy images is easy, because there is no partition table:

    losetup /dev/loop0 /usr/local/bochs/dlxlinux/floppya.img

    Now you can use the image like a real floppy:

    - format           : mkfs.minix /dev/loop0
    - filesystem check : fsck.minix /dev/loop0
    - mount            : mount /dev/loop0 -o loop /mnt/floppy

    Before you want to restart bochs you must do this:

    losetup -d /dev/loop0

    Don't forget to umount before.

2.  If you want access to a hard disk image, you have to calculate the size of
    the first cylinder. This value is the offset argument for losetup.

    offset = bytes per sector * sectors per cylinder

    The command for dlxlinux image looks like this:

    losetup /dev/loop0 /usr/local/bochs/dlxlinux/hd10meg.img -o 8704

    For images created by bximage you must use the value 32256.

3.  The hard disk image access doesn't work if the image contains more than
    one partition.

4.  I have made this tests with Linux and I don't know how
    this could be done with other operating systems.

</para>
<para>
The following example mounts a Windows 95 hard disk image called <filename>Windows 95 B (2031-16-63)</filename>
into the FreeBSD file system. It is specific to FreeBSD 5.x; for
hints on how to do the same task on FreeBSD 4.x, or for more information in
general, check the proper section of the FreeBSD handbook:
<ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/disks-virtual.html">Network, Memory, and File-Backed File Systems</ulink>.
You can use the same procedure for mounting floppy disk images.

<section id="SMP"><title>Simulating a Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) Machine</title>
<para>
Bochs can now simulate an SMP machine when you use <option>--enable-smp</option> in the
configure command.  SMP support was added by Bryce Denney, who
was very interested in watching a multiprocessor operating system work
at a low level.  It should also be helpful to operating system developers
who are writing SMP drivers, or just for users who want to test drive
an SMP machine to see what it looks like.
</para>
<para>
Starting with Bochs 2.2.6 you can set up the number of processors in the
<filename>bochsrc</filename>. See <xref linkend="bochsopt-cpu"> how to
set up the number of processors.
</para>
<para>
It is important to understand that configuring bochs for 4 processors will NOT
make your single-threaded applications run faster in general!  On the contrary,
it has to spend time simulating idle processors as well as the ones doing your
task.  The point is to simulate an SMP system, not to speed up a uniprocessor
application.

<section id="dlxlinux-networking"><title>Setting Up Networking in DLX Linux</title>
<para>
All Bochs binaries come with a working version of DLX Linux.  This section
describes how to configure networking in Bochs and enable it within
DLX Linux.  First you must add a <varname>ne2k</varname> line in your bochsrc
file.  Then, when you boot the DLX Linux image, you need to type some Linux
commands to set up an IP address, a network route, and a name server.
</para>

<para>
When you have an <varname>ne2k</varname> line in your bochsrc file, Bochs
will emulate a network card called an NE2000.  Below are some examples of valid
<varname>ne2k</varname> lines for various operating systems.  Choose the
one that's closest to what you need, add it to your bochsrc file, and
edit the values if necessary.
<screen>
  # sample for Mac OS X
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x300, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=fbsd, ethdev=en0
  # sample for FreeBSD
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x300, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=fbsd, ethdev=xl0
  # sample for Linux
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x300, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=linux, ethdev=eth0
  # sample for Windows
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x300, irq=9, mac=00:c4:3B:00:C3:00, ethmod=win32, ethdev=NE2000
</screen>
You see the pattern.  Usually you won't need to change the I/O address, IRQ
number, or MAC address.  The <varname>ethmod</varname> value depends on your
host operating system, and it must be either <constant>null</constant>,
<constant>fbsd</constant> (for FreeBSD or OpenBSD), <constant>linux</constant>,
or <constant>win32</constant>.  The <varname>ethdev</varname> setting is the
name of the network interface on your system, and is also OS-dependent.  On
UNIX systems you can get the name of the network interface by running
<command>ifconfig</command>.  (Don't choose the loopback interface.)  On
Windows systems, the correct ethdev setting is not always obvious, so we
provide a utility called <command>niclist</command> to list the names of
network interfaces to use.  When you run <command>niclist</command>, it will
suggest an <varname>ne2k</varname> line which is a very good first try.
</para>

<para>
Next, if you are on a UNIX machine you will need to become the root user.
Since bochs is sending and receiving raw network packets, you need to be root
to use the network device.  To allow normal users to do this would be a
security problem.
</para>

<para>
Now run Bochs to boot DLX Linux.  Press enter a few times to accept the default
configuration choices.  This tells Bochs read the configuration file and then
begin.  DLX Linux should boot in the Bochs window, and you should see
that Linux detects the NE2000 card.  Eventually it gets to a login prompt.
<screen>

  eth0: NE2000 found at 0x300, using IRQ 9.
</screen>
</para>

<para>
At the login prompt, type "root" to log in as root. Then type the ifconfig and
route commands to set up networking.  The exact IP numbers in the example won't
work for you; you must choose an IP configuration that is legal on your
network.

<screen>
  dlx login: root
  Linux 1.3.89.
  dlx:~# ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.99         # set bochs IP address
  dlx:~# route add -net 192.168.0.0         # first 3 numbers match IP
  dlx:~# route add default gw 192.168.0.1   # your gateway to the net
  dlx:~# _
</screen>
</para>

<note>
<para>
The bochs IP address must be an unused IP address on your
network.  If you duplicate someone else's IP address, your network will
become very confused.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Finally, the network is ready and you can test it out with ping, telnet, or ftp
to various machines by their numerical IP address.  Keep in mind that for all
UNIX host platforms, Bochs networking cannot talk to the host machine.  That
means the host machine can't be the gateway either.  You need another physical
machine on the network that bochs can talk to.  On Win32 this restriction does
not apply.
</para>

<note>
<para>
When you have a working network configuration, you can make DLX Linux recreate
the same settings the next time you boot.  Just add the ifconfig and route
commands to the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.  I won't try to describe how
to use the <command>vi</command> editor in this limited amount of space...

To configure a name
server, set up <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> with the IP address of
your name server as shown.

<section id="config-tuntap"><title>Configuring and using a tuntap network interface</title>
<para>
If you use linux (optionally FreeBSD and Solaris, not tested),
you may want to access the network through a tuntap interface. The main
advantage of this interface, is that the guest has access to the host. The guest can even
have access to the whole network if the host routes or masquerades the guest requests.
No extra IP address is needed, all can be done using private IP addresses.

<screen>
  TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space programs.
  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet device, which
  instead of receiving packets from a physical media, receives them from
  user space program and instead of sending packets via physical media
  writes them to the user space program.

  When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers corresponding
  net device tunX or tapX. After a program closed above devices, driver will
  automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and all routes corresponding to it.

<section id="using-socket"><title>Using the 'socket' networking module</title>
<para>
The original patch for the 'socket' networking module has been written by
Mariusz Matuszek in 2003. It supported interconnecting two Bochs sessions
running on the same machine via UDP using an external program called 'bxhub'.
</para>
<para>
The 'socket' networking module is now integrated in the Bochs code with these
extensions:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Integrated 'vnet' server features (ARP, ICMP-echo, DHCP and TFTP)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Command line options for 'bxhub' added for base UDP port and 'vnet' server features</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Support for connects from up to 6 Bochs sessions</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Support for connecting 'bxhub' on other machine</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
The 'socket' networking module uses two UDP ports per Bochs session. By default
the first session receives packets from port 40000 and sends packets to port
40001. The second session uses then the ports 40002 and 40003. For further
sessions the port numbers are incremented accordingly. The port number for
receiving packets is specified with the 'ethdev' parameter of the bochsrc
line for the network adapter. The format is <emphasis>host:port</emphasis>
for connecting the 'bxhub' utility. If it runs on the same machine
('localhost') the host name can be omitted.

<title>Using Bochs internal debugger</title>

<para>
You can now conditionally compile in a GDB like command line debugger, that
allows you to set breakpoints, step through instructions, and other
useful functions.  If there isn't a command for something you believe
is generally useful for the debugger, let me know and I'll implement
it if possible.
</para>

<note><para>
This section describes how to enable and use the Bochs command line debugger.
For it's builtin graphical front-end please see the <link linkend="debugger-gui">debugger gui</link>
section how to enable it.
</para></note>

<para>
To use the debugger, you must configure Bochs with the
<option>--enable-debugger</option> and <option>--enable-disasm</option> flags.
For example:
<screen>
  ./configure --enable-debugger --enable-disasm
</screen>
</para>

<note><para>
You must use flex version 2.5.4 or greater.  I have heard that
version 2.5.2 will not work.
</para></note>

<para>
When you first start up Bochs, you will see the command line prompt

<screen>
  bochs:1>
</screen>

From here, you may use the following commands:

  disassemble start end       Disassemble instructions in given linear address
                              range, inclusive of start, exclusive of end.
                              Use "set $disassemble_size =" to tell
                              debugger desired segment size.  Use a value for
                              end of less than start (or zero) if you only
                              want the first instruction disassembled.

  disassemble switch-mode     Switch between Intel and AT&amp;T disassebly styles
                              for debugger disassembler.

  disassemble size = n        Tell debugger what segment size to use when
                              the "disassemble" command is used.  Use values
                              of 0, 16 or 32 for n.  Value of 0 means
			      "use segment size specified by current CS
			      segment". Default is 0.

  set $auto_disassemble = n   Cause debugger to disassemble current instruction
                              every time execution stops if n=1.  Default is 0.
                              Segment size of current CPU context is used for
                              disassembly, so the "disassemble size" variable is
                              ignored.

<title>Instrumentation</title>
<para>

To use instrumentation features in bochs, you must compile in support for it.
You should build a custom instrumentation library in a separate directory in
the "instrument/" directory.  To tell configure which instrumentation library
you want to use, use the <option>--enable-instrumentation</option> option.

The default library consists of a set of stubs, and the following are
equivalent:

<screen>
  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation
  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation="instrument/stubs"
</screen>

You could make a separate directory with your custom library,
for example "instrument/myinstrument", copy the contents of
the "instrument/stubs" directory to it, then customize it.  Use:

<screen>
  ./configure [...] --enable-instrumentation="instrument/myinstrument"

<screen>sba <varname>time</varname></screen>

Insert a time break point at "time" ("time" is a 64-bit integer followed by "L", for example 1000L).

<screen>print-stack [<varname>num words</varname>]</screen>

Print the <varname>num words</varname> top 16-bit words on the stack. <varname>Num
words</varname> defaults to 16. Only works reliably in protected mode when
the base address of the stack segment is zero.

<screen>modebp</screen>

Toggles CPU mode switch breakpoint.

<screen>ldsym [global] <varname>filename</varname> [<varname>offset</varname>]</screen>

Load symbols from file <varname>filename</varname>. If the global keyword is
added, then the the symbols will be visible in all contexts for which
symbols have not been loaded. <varname>Offset</varname> (default is 0) is added to
every symbol entry. The symbols are loaded in the current (executing)
context.

<para>
The graphical front-end for the Bochs command line debugger
is available for Windows and GTK2 hosts.

<para>
To use the gui debugger, you must configure Bochs with the
default debugger switches and the <option>--enable-debugger-gui</option> flag.
For example:
<screen>
  ./configure --enable-debugger --enable-disasm --enable-debugger-gui
</screen>
</para>
<para>
At runtime you need to add the value <option>gui_debug</option> to the
<link linkend="bochsopt-displaylibrary">display_library</link> options parameter
in order to use the gui instead of the command line debugger. This example shows how to
use it with the 'x' gui:

<title>Using Bochs and the remote GDB stub</title>
<para>
This section covers how you can use Bochs with a remote GDB stub to debug your kernel.
</para>

<section>
<title>Configuring Bochs</title>
<para>
The GDB stub is not active in standard Bochs binary package.  So you must recompile Bochs.
Download the Bochs source package, unpack it and run the configure script
with the <option>--enable-gdb-stub</option> argument.

<screen>
  $ ./configure --enable-gdb-stub
</screen>

After that, just run make and you should have a Bochs binary that contain a GDB stub in your directory.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Running Bochs</title>
<para>
Enable the <link linkend="bochsopt-gdbstub">gdbstub option</link> in <filename>bochsrc</filename>, then just start Bochs as normal. Bochs will stop and wait for GDB to connect to the stub.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Running GDB</title>
<para>
Bochs GDB stub waits for a connection on TCP port 1234. Just start GDB like this:

<screen>
  $ gdb YOUR-KERNEL
  .
  .
  .
  (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
  Remote debugging using localhost:1234
  0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
  (gdb)
</screen>

You are now connected to the remote GDB stub in Bochs. You are now able to set breakpoints.
Use the continue (c) command to continue the simulation.

Hitting ^C works. Example:

<screen>
  Program received signal 0, Signal 0.
  syscall_testsuite_result (aux=0x1f11fe4) at ../rtmk/syscalls.c:33
  33     {

<section id="serial-port"><title>Using the serial port</title>

        ) running as guest, on a debian x86 linux 2.4.19 host.
</para>
<para>
        For the examples to work in dlxlinux, after you login as root, you will need to
        kill the running gpm, as it grabs the serial port.

        <section><title>Interactivity : connecting to a virtual terminal</title>
        <para>
        The second example shows how to connect to the guest OS, using a
        virtual terminal on the host OS.
        </para>
        <para>
        First, you need to find an unused virtual terminal. Typically,
        X uses vt7; vt8 and up are unused. On my system, I can
        switch from X to vt9 by pressing ctrl-alt-f9 : this virtual
        terminal is not used, the screen is all black. Pressing alt-f7
        switches back to X.
        </para>
        <para>
        Once you found an unused vt, update the com1: section of your
        configuration file:
        <screen>
com1: enabled=1, mode=term, dev=/dev/tty9
        </screen>
        The number must be set according to the terminal you want to use (here 9).
        </para>
        <para>
        Now, launch dlxlinux. After you log in as root and kill gpm,
        enter the following command:
        <screen>
dlx:~# /sbin/agetty 38400 cua0
        </screen>
        If you switch to vt9, you can see dlx welcome banner, and the login prompt:

        Note that dlxlinux is configured so you can not login as root from a
        serial port. If you want to login, you have to create a new user first.
        </para>
        <para>
        Also, if you plan to use this feature, the best would be to deactivate
        gpm in /etc/rc.d/rc.local, and add a agetty line in /etc/inittab,
        for example:
<screen>
T0:1234:respawn:/bin/agetty 38400 cua0

        </section>
        <section><title>Interactivity : connecting to a pseudo terminal</title>
        <para>
        The third example is very similar to the second one, except that we
        connect to the guest OS with kermit as client, and we the connection
        is done through a pseudo terminal.
        </para>
        <para>
        This example uses /dev/ptyp0 and /dev/ttyp0 as pseudo terminal pair.
        We will tie Bochs to the controlling terminal, whereas kermit will
        use the slave terminal.
        </para>
        <para>
        Update the com1: section of your configuration file:
        <screen>

        and lauch dlxlinux. After you log in as root, enter the command:
        <screen>

<ulink url="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/techdata.html">Bochs tech specs page</ulink>.
        </para>
        <para>
El Torito specifies 3 ways to have a bootable CD:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>floppy emulation boot: A standard floppy image is burnt on the CD.
In this case the BIOS has to redirect all first floppy accesses to this
image and the real floppy drive becomes the second one.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
a "no emulation" boot: In this case the BIOS is instructed to load an
arbitrary number of sectors straight into memory, and execute it.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
hard disk emulation: A hard disk image is burnt on the CD. The
BIOS has to redirect all hard disk accesses to that image. The real hard disks
are still available, with BIOS numbers 81h and up.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

In Bochs 2.0, hard disk emulation is not implemented in the BIOS.
There are also subtilities about multiple boot-images CD-ROMs, that are
not handled by Bochs.
        </para>

        <para>
However, our BIOS may be more strict than real PC BIOSes, I don't know.
But I would definitely be interested to know of any CD that can boot
on real hardware, but does not in Bochs.
        </para>

        <para>
When failing to boot from CD-ROM, the BIOS outputs
the reason of the failure as
an error code, in the log file, and on the screen.
        </para>

        <para>
Here is a summary of what can happen when booting from the CD.

For the first two errors, an ata-*: type=cdrom is probably missing
from the configuration file. This is what you get if no cdrom has
been defined in Bochs conf file.
</para>

<para>

For this error, the cdrom support has not been compiled in Bochs,

For these errors, the data has been read from the cd, but
the cd does not conform to the El Torito specification. This

0x08 boot catalog : bad header
0x09 boot catalog : bad platform
0x0A boot catalog : bad signature

now the cd is eltorito, but the boot catalog is corrupted, or
the cd was made to boot on a ppc system. This should not happen
for a x86 bootable cd.

        <title>Disk translation</title>
        <para>
Since the beginning of the PC era, disks have grown in size by a factor of 10000. Due to
differences between the ATA specification and BIOSes implementations, when disks reached
critical sizes, it
became necessary to translate the CHS geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors per track)
between the BIOS (int 13h) and the ATA interface. Please refer to the
<ulink url="http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/pcinfo/hardware/atafaq/atafq.htm">ATA-FAQ</ulink>
and
<ulink url="http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiwchs.htm">Hale Landis' document</ulink>
for a complete discussion of the problem.
        </para>
        <para>
Unfortunately, there has never been any standard on the translation algorithms.
        </para>
        <para>
Bochs implements 4 well-known algorithms, selectable in the configuration file
in the "<command>ataX-xxxx: ..., translation='algorithm'</command>" section.

    a standard bitshift algorithm (named Extended-CHS)
    is used to translate the CHS between
    the int13h interface
    and the ATA interface. The translation is achieved by
    multiplying/dividing the cylinder/head count by a power of 2
    (2, 4 or 8).
    (a factor of 16 could not be used because the
    head count would become 256, and MS-DOS thought this was 0)
    Note that the number of sectors per track is not changed, so
    a lower spt value will lead to a lower maximum disk size.

    a revised bitshift algorithm (called Revised Extended-CHS)
    is used to translate the CHS between
    the int13h interface
    and the ATA interface. First the number of physical heads is forced to
    15, and the number of cylinders is adjusted accordingly.
    Then, as in the simple extended CHS algorithm, the translation
    is achieved by
    multiplying/dividing the cylinder/head count by a power of 2
    (2, 4, 8 or 16).
    The head count being forced to 15, it can safely be multiplied by 16
    without crashing dos.
    Note that the number of sectors per track is not changed, so
    a lower spt value will lead to a lower maximum disk size.

    <entry>
    a LBA-assisted algorithm
    is used to translate the CHS between
    the int13h interface
    and the ATA interface. The translation is achieved by
    first computing the physical size of the disk (LBA=C*H*S).
    Then the sectors per track is forced to 63, and the head count
    to 255. Then the cylinder count is computed (C=LBA/(63*255))
    Note that the number of sectors per track is forced to 63
    in the logical geometry, regardless of the actual geometry
    reported by the disk.
    Also note that the LBA-assisted algorithm has nothing to do with
    LBA access at the ATA interface.

        <para>
Setting a specific CHS translation should be done if you use a disk dump
of an actual disk, or use a real disk as a block device. You need to
know which geometry was used to format the disk, and which translation
was used. You must not set the translation to 'auto'.
        </para>

        <note>
        <para>
rechs translation should only be useful for Compaq users who wants to
use a disk as a block device. Please report if you know any other
system that use such translation.
        </para>
        </note>

        <para>
If you plan to create a new disk image (for example with bximage),
format it and install an OS on it, select the "auto" translation
for an automatic selection
of the best algorithm based on the disk image size. Be warned that an image created
with the "auto" translation might not be readable with previous versions of Bochs.
Upward compatibility will be maintained.
        </para>

<note>
<para>
This translation applies only to int13h BIOS disk accesses. Older OSes (e.g. MS-DOS)
tend to use them a lot.  On modern OSes, disk accesses through BIOS int13h are
limited to boot loaders.
The usual rules and tricks of the installed OS still apply (ie 1024 cylinders boot limit).

Your window manager may trap the key combination you want to enter
in Bochs guest OS, for example <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>control</keycap><keycap>alt</keycap><keycap>delete</keycap></keycombo>. Here is a work-around:
</para>
<para>
Press and hold <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>control</keycap><keycap>alt</keycap></keycombo>,
move your mouse cursor outside of the Bochs window.  Release them, move
the cursor back in the Bochs window and press <keycap>delete</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
This should work for any key combination.
</para>
<para>
If you need one key combination frequently, set it up as user key combination
with the <link linkend="bochsopt-keyboard">keyboard</link> option in your
configuration file. This key combination is sent to the guest OS when you press
the user button in the <link linkend="headerbar">headerbar</link>.

==========================
I can only confirm that SciTech finally made a VBE driver
for Windows. It works out of the box, at least with win95
as guest OS, provided you use Bochs 2.1 with the LGPL
vgabios.

Here is how I did it :
- install win95 with the vga driver.
- download sdd 7 beta from <ulink url="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download382.html"></ulink>
- download pmhelp.vxd from <ulink url="http://unununium.org/viewcvs/snap/redist/release/pmhelp.vxd"></ulink>
- copy pmhelp.vxd to the win95 system directory
- install sdd7

800x600 and 1024x768 in 16 and 24 bpp modes here.
I did not try 32bpp.

  <title>Notes about Voodoo Graphics usage</title>

  <para>
  Bochs supports the emulation of 4 different 3dfx Voodoo Graphics adapter models.
  The Voodoo1 and Voodoo2 models are 3D-only add-on cards and require a VGA
  compatible primary device. The Voodoo Banshee and it's successor Voodoo3 have
  both a VGA core and a 2D/3D core, so no other VGA card is required. The 2D/3D
  cards can be assigned to AGP if the i440BX chipset is selected (slot #5).
  </para>
  <para>
  To emulate the Voodoo1 or Voodoo2 device only the "model" parameter of the
  bochsrc option "voodoo" needs to be set. If the vga extension option is set
  to "voodoo" in that case, the primary display adapter is an ISA VGA card.
  </para>
  <para>
  For emulating the Voodoo Banshee or Voodoo3 adapter, the vga extension option
  must be set to "voodoo". Using a different primary display adapter and a
  Banshee compatible device with it's VGA interface disabled is not
  implemented yet. Both Banshee and Voodoo3 currently need a specific external
  VGA BIOS, since a Voodoo extension for the LGPL'd VGABIOS is not written yet.

to operate on a single partition (e.g. mount with loopback, create file system,
fsck, etc.).

        Large hard drive can be created, and only used space will be stored

        Multiple sparse drive images can be mounted on top of each other.
        Writes go to the top image.  This allows several similar configurations
        to share a master "base" file, and also allows file system rollback or
        no-write options.  Up to 10 disk images can be layered on top of each other.

    Undoable disks are commitable/rollbackable disk images.
    An undoable disk is based on a read-only image, associated
    with a growing redolog, that contains all changes (writes)
    made to the base image content. Currently, base images of
    types 'flat', 'sparse', 'growing', 'vmware3', 'vmware4' and
    'vpc' are supported.

<section><title>description</title>
<para>
    The "vvfat" disk image mode is mostly a port of Qemu's "virtual VFAT" block
    driver (written by Johannes E. Schindelin). It supports the read-only part
    of this implementation plus some additions. The structures of the
    virtual disk are created from the contents of the specified local directory
    when Bochs is starting. All writes to this virtual disk go to a volatile
    redolog and when closing Bochs, the user can decide whether or not to commit
    the changes. If "No" is seclected, all changes will be lost when Bochs quits
    and the files of the local directory are not modified. Otherwise the changes
    of files and directories are committed. WARNING: Don't use important data without
    backup in the "vvfat" directory when using this "optional commit" feature.
</para>
<para>
    In addition to Qemu's "vvfat" implementation the Bochs one supports configurable
    disk geometry, FAT32 and reading MBR and/or boot sector from file. When using
    the autodetection feature, the CHS values 1024/16/63 (Qemu defaults) are used.
    To use an MBR image file from a real disk it must be named <filename>vvfat_mbr.bin</filename>
    and placed in the specified directory. Bochs uses the geometry and file system
    type from this file and doesn't show it on the virtual disk. The same applies
    to a boot sector image file, but it must be named <filename>vvfat_boot.bin</filename>.
    Using both image file is also possible if they match (grabbed from the same disk).
</para>
<para>
    FAT32 is enabled for disk with minimum 2 GB size, or if MBR / boot sector image
    enable this filesystem. When using "vvfat" for a floppy, FAT12 is used (1.44M
    media only). In all other cases FAT16 is used. Long filename support
    is always present.
</para>
<para>
    Special FAT file attributes are stored in a special file named <filename>vvfat_attr.cfg</filename>.
    When using the "optional commit" feature, modified attributes are saved to this file.
    The "optional commit" also supports setting the file modification date and time.

<section><title>path</title>

    The "path" option of the ataX-xxx directive in the configuration file
    must point to an existing local directory. The redolog name can be set
    with the "journal" option of the same directive. If not set, the redolog
    name is created by adding the filename "vvfat.dir.redolog" to the path.
    A random suffix is also appended to the redolog name.

    An extended partition or other file system types are not supported.
</para>
<para>
    The "vvfat" implementation does not support save/restore, since there is no

<section id="using-bximage"><title>Using the bximage tool</title>
<para>
Bximage is an easy to use console based tool for creating, converting and
resizing disk images, particularly for use with Bochs. It also supports
committing redolog files to their base images. It is completely interactive
if no command line arguments are used. It can be switched to a non-interactive
mode  if all required parameters are given in the command line.
</para>
<para>
When you run bximage without one of the following options, it will appear in
interactive  mode and ask for all required parameters to manipulate an image.
<screen>
Usage: bximage [options] [filename1] [filename2]

Supported options:
  -mode=...     operation mode (create, convert, resize, commit, info)
  -fd=...       create: floppy image with size code
  -hd=...       create/resize: hard disk image with size in megabytes (M)
                or gigabytes (G)
  -imgmode=...  create/convert: hard disk image mode
  -b            convert/resize: create a backup of the source image
                commit: create backups of the base image and redolog file
  -q            quiet mode (don't prompt for user input)
  --help        display this help and exit

Other arguments:
  filename1     create:  new image file

<para>
With this function a disk image can be converted from one mode (format)
to another. The type of the source image is auto-detected. For the target
format it supports the same disk image modes as the create function. If the
name of the new image file is not specified or identical to the source one
and you have enabled the backup switch, a backup of the source file will be
created with it's original name plus the suffix ".orig".
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Resize image</title>
<para>
This function can be used to increase the virtual disk size of an image.
It supports the same disk image modes as the create function.
Making a disk image smaller is not supported, since it may damage the
disk and data will be lost. If the name of the new image file is not
specified or identical to the source one and you have enabled the backup
switch, a backup of the source file will be created with it's original name
plus the suffix ".orig".
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Commit 'undoable' redolog to base image</title>
<para>
The type of the base image is auto-detected. The name of the redolog
file only needs to be specified if it is not based on the base image.
If you have enabled the backup switch, backups of the original base and
redolog files will still be created with their original name plus the
suffix ".orig".
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Disk image info</title>
<para>
This function can be used to determine the disk image format, geometry
and size. Note that Bochs can only detect the formats growing, sparse,
vmware3, vmware4 and vpc correctly. Other images with a file size
multiple of 512 are treated as flat ones. If the image doesn't support
returning the geometry, the cylinders are calculated based on 16 heads
and 63 sectors per track.

<chapter id="guests"><title>Guest operating systems</title>
<para>
In the past several tweaks were necessary to install a guest OS inside of Bochs.
Nowadays it's almost the same as installing it on a real machine. There are only
a few Bochs specific issues you should know about. Note that we cannot give you
a full installation guide if you don't know how to install an OS in the real
world. The following remarks apply to all guest OS installations. Some specific
issues are reported in the next sections.
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
First of all you need the installation media or image (floppy/CD/DVD).
For platforms that don't support raw device access it might be necessary to
create an image from the media. You must read the message regarding software
licenses in <xref linkend="thirdparty"> before you install or use a commercial
guest operating system in Bochs.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Then you need to create a hard drive image with bximage. For the
required size see the documentation of the OS you'd like to install. See
<xref linkend="using-bximage"> how to create the image.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Finally you have to create configuration for your guest OS. You can
edit the sample configuration distributed with Bochs or use the configuration
interface to adjust the settings. Check the documentation of your guest OS for
the required memory size, cpu speed and supported hardware.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Now you should be able to run Bochs and start the installation process. Depending
on the host cpu speed and the size of the guest OS it can take a few minutes or
even some hours.

    <title>Getting Knoppix</title>

    <para>
      Knoppix is a live CD (700M) or live DVD (3.2G) based on Debian GNU/Linux, with lots of
      ready-to-run programs (web browser, office suite, a few games, and more), using
      <abbrev>KDE</abbrev> as desktop environment. It can be booted directly from CD, without
      any installation needed. You can download it from <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.org/">knoppix.org</ulink>.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Preparing Bochs</title>

    <para>
      As Knoppix runs completely from CD/DVD, you don't need to setup a hard disk. You just need to set up
      the location of the downloaded ISO image in your <filename>bochsrc</filename>, and make Bochs boot
      from it. Because Knoppix contains a graphical user interface, and has no other storage space but
      the emulated RAM, it needs at least 128MB of it, see
      <link linkend="bochsopt-memory">megs option</link>. Furthermore, you need to enable VBE support in
      Bochs (see <xref linkend="vesa-notes">).
    </para>

  <title>FreeBSD 5.2.1</title>

  <para>
    Contributed by Alexander Schuch.
  </para>

  <para>
    This section describes how to install FreeBSD 5.2.1 (miniinst) inside of Bochs, using an ISO image.
  </para>

  <section>
    <title>Getting FreeBSD</title>

    <para>
      As <filename>5.2.1-RELEASE-i386-miniinst.iso</filename> (240M) is no longer available from
      the FreeBSD FTP server, you might want to ask a (file) search engine of your choice
      for a download location. Once you downloaded the file, you should check its integrity
      using the provided MD5 checksum from the
      <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.2.1R/announce.html">FreeBSD 5.2.1 release announcement</ulink>.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Preparing Bochs</title>

    <para>
      Create a new hard disk image using <command>bximage</command> (see
      <xref linkend="using-bximage">) with a size of at least 350M, as the standard
      installation uses 280M on its own.
    </para>

    <para>
      Next, you need to setup your <filename>bochsrc</filename> so that Bochs knows about your
     (still empty) hard disk, as well as about your ISO image. Make Bochs boot from CD-ROM and
     start the emulation.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Installing FreeBSD</title>

    <para>
      This is just a very short step-by-step installation guide for FreeBSD in Bochs. It
      doesn't explain what you do nor why you do it, it just tells you how to do it.
      For in-deepth information refer to the FreeBSD handbook:
      <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/install.html">Installing FreeBSD</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      FreeBSD boots up and shows a nice (text-mode) boot option screen. Just press
      <keycap>return</keycap> there, that is, use the default option. After loading the
      kernel and needed device drivers, select 'Standard' in the installation menu.
    </para>

    <para>
      A fdisk like partition program is loaded next, where you just press <keycap>A</keycap>
      to use the entire disk, followed by <keycap>Q</keycap> to finish the selection. The next
      dialog asks for the boot manager you want to use. Select 'Standard' and continue.
    </para>

    <para>
      In the Disklabel Editor, you have to setup the layout of your partition. If your (virtual)
      hard disk is large enough, you can press <keycap>A</keycap> for auto-layout. However, you
      need to make sure that the <filename class="directory">/usr</filename> partition is at least
      250M large, or you will end up with a 'disk full' error message during installation. If
      this is not the case, select one partition after another and press <keycap>D</keycap> to
      delete it again. After you deleted all partitions, create two new ones. The first one will
      be a swap partition; press <keycap>C</keycap>, enter '32M' as size and select 'Swap' from
      the dialog. Press <keycap>C</keycap> again, and accept the remaining capacity for your
      filesystem partition. Choose 'FS' as partition type and enter '/' (slash) as mount point.
      Your partition layout is complete now; press <keycap>Q</keycap> to leave the editor.

      <note><para>
        This 'all-in-one' partition layout is not recommended for a FreeBSD installation on a
        real box; use 'auto-layout' or something comparable to that there.
      </para></note>
    </para>

    <para>
      You now can choose what set of programs/files (distribution) you want to install. Take
      'User' (option 8), and select 'No' when asked to install the ports collection. You are
      back in the distribution selection, where you select the first item, called 'Exit'.
      Choose to install from 'CD/DVD' and answer the 'Are you sure?' dialog with 'yes'.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now, while FreeBSD installs, it is a very good time to take a look at the
      <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/docs.html">FreeBSD documentation</ulink>, especially
      the <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/index.html">FreeBSD handbook</ulink>
      and the <ulink url="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/faq/index.html">FreeBSD FAQ</ulink>.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Post-installation configuration</title>

    <para>
      All files are installed on your (virtual) hard disk now, and FreeBSD is ready for getting set
      up. As this is a very basic FreeBSD installation, you just answer 'no' to nearly all questions,
      but the one about your mouse: Answer 'yes' for PS/2 mouse, and choose 'Exit' at mouse configuration.
      The miniinst FreeBSD ISO image contains nearly no binary packages, so don't browse the package
      collection. Then, when asked to create a new user account, answer 'yes' and create a new user
      called 'bochs' (or whatever you like). You might want to use <filename>/bin/csh</filename>
      or <filename>/bin/tcsh</filename> as shell rather than <filename>/bin/sh</filename>. Next,
      you are asked for the super user (root) password. The installation is finished now, there is
      no need to visit the general configuration menu again - answer 'no' to that question. FreeBSD
      will then reboot. Shutdown Bochs, as soon as the (virtual) computer boots.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Using FreeBSD</title>

    <para>
      Open your <filename>bochsrc</filename> and change the boot sequence, so that Bochs will boot
      from hard disk, rather than from CD-ROM from now on. Start Bochs again and watch the FreeBSD
      boot process.
    </para>

    <para>
      Your keyboard might use the wrong keymap, so login (into FreeBSD) as super user and use
      <command>/stand/sysinstall</command> to start the FreeBSD configuration program. Choose
      'keymap' and select the keymap you want to use.
    </para>

    <para>
      You have successfully installed FreeBSD now. You might want to shutdown FreeBSD using
      <command>shutdown -h now</command>, quit Bochs, and create a backup of your hard disk
      image, before you start playing around.

any other DOS as a guest operating system in Bochs.</para>
<section><title>Accessing your CDROM</title>
<para>
To access your CDROM in DOS, you must download an IDE CDROM driver.
Bochs emulates a very generic CDROM drive, and several drivers are known to
work.  Others don't.  This section describes how to set up your
<filename>config.sys</filename> and <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> to enable
the CDROM.
</para>

<para>
The drivers that have been reported to work are
<filename>OAKCDROM.SYS</filename> that comes with several versions of Windows
and <filename>SBIDE.SYS</filename> version 1.21 from Creative
Labs<footnote>
<para>
To get it, go to <ulink url="http://creative.com">Creative Labs web
site</ulink>, click on Support, then click Download Files.  You get to a screen
where you must select the operating system and the product for which you want
the driver.  Choose DOS as the operating system, and "CD-ROM: 4x and above" as
the product.  There are several choices, but you want
<filename>sbide121.exe</filename> from April 15, 1997.  Version 2.0 does not
work.  The download file is a self-extracting ZIP file, so on
DOS or Windows you just run it; on other platforms you can try using
the unzip command.  The driver is called SBIDE.SYS.  </para>
</footnote> and OAKCDROM.SYS that comes with several versions of Windows.
Copy the driver to your boot disk, and then set up the startup files as follows.
</para>
<screen>
config.sys:
  device=himem.sys
  device=oakcdrom.sys /D:CD001
      -or-
  device=sbide.sys /D:CD001 /P:1f0,14,3f6

autoexec.bat:
  mscdex.exe /M:10 /D:CD001
</screen>

<para>
If the files mentioned in <filename>config.sys</filename> and
<filename>autoexec.bat</filename> are not in the root directory, give the full
pathname, like <filename>c:\windows\himem.sys</filename>.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>SB16 driver for DOS</title>
<para>
To use the SB16 device in DOS you need to load a driver for it. The file <filename>
SBBASIC.EXE</filename> contains a self-extracting archive with all required file.
After unpacking it to <varname>C:\SB16</varname> you can execute <filename>INSTALL.EXE</filename>
to install the driver. The file <filename>DISK.ID</filename> should contain the version
string <varname>SDR-31STD-1-US (Revision 1)</varname>.
</para>
</section>
<section><title>Bootdisks of early DOS versions</title>
<para>
On the Web there are bootdisks available for most of the DOS versions ever released,
but some of them have been reported to fail in Bochs. The bootdisk for MS-DOS 1.25
contains a boot sector of a newer DOS version, so it would fail on real hardware,
too. The floppy image for MS-DOS 2.11 has a boot sector that tries to boot from
hard disk instead of the floppy.

</para>

<para>
You must read the message regarding software licenses in
<xref linkend="thirdparty"> before you install SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 as a guest operating system in Bochs.
</para>

<para>
Back in April and May of 2002, I did some work on Bochs
in order to get it to install and boot SCO's OpenServer 5.0.5 (OSR5).
Since that time, I have had several e-mails asking about this error message
or that.  The newsgroup posts done at the time had all of the information that I knew,
so I pointed people there.  (I had not used Bochs since...)
In February of 2003, I got another such e-mail.
Since the sender indicated they were willing to pay me to get this going for them,
I agreed to spend a few hours on it (for free, which is not common :-}).  Subsequently,
I decided to document this once and for all.  (I did not charge anyone anything, this time...)
</para>

<para>
Note: These steps were originally used with Bochs 1.4.1 (or thereabouts,
since I was using CVS heavily at the time).  It is possible (likely) that later versions of Bochs
are more tolerant/bug free, and this install may be abbreviated.  However, I have not tried
to streamline it at all.
</para>

<para>
These steps were performed and confirmed using Bochs version 2.0.2, and SCO OpenServer version 5.0.5.
The host OS was Red Hat Linux 8.0.
</para>

<para>
First, I downloaded the tarball, and extracted the source tree.  I decided to use the tarball
instead of the RPM so that I knew what options were compiled in, etc.
<screen>
linux-$ tar -xzvf bochs-2.0.2.tar.gz
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Next, I configured and compiled Bochs...
<screen>
linux-$ cd bochs-2.0.2
linux-$ ./configure --enable-cdrom --enable-ne2000
linux-$ make
</screen>
</para>

<para>
I then created my disk image:
<screen>
linux-$ ./bximage
========================================================================
                                bximage
                  Disk Image Creation Tool for Bochs
========================================================================

Do you want to create a floppy disk image or a hard disk image?
Please type hd or fd. [hd] hd

What kind of image should I create?
Please type flat, sparse or growing. [flat]

Enter the hard disk size in megabytes, between 1 and 8257535
[10] 2048

I will create a hard disk image with
  cyl=4161
  heads=16
  sectors per track=63
  total sectors=4194288
  total size=2047.99 megabytes

What should I name the image?
[c.img] hd0.img

Writing: [] Done.

I wrote 2147475456 bytes to hd0.img.

The following line should appear in your .bochsrc:
  ata0-master: type=disk, path="hd0.img", cylinders=4161, heads=16, spt=63
</screen>
</para>

<para>
I then created my .bochsrc file.  I did this via the interactive portion of Bochs, with the
end result as follows:
<programlisting>
floppya: 1_44="/dev/fd0", status=inserted
floppyb: 1_44="b.img", status=inserted
ata0: enabled=1, ioaddr1=0x1f0, ioaddr2=0x3f0, irq=14
ata0-master: type=disk, path="hd0.img", cylinders=4161, heads=16, spt=63, translation=auto, biosdetect=auto, model="Generic 1234"

debug: action=ignore
keyboard: type=mf, keymap=, user_shortcut=none

</programlisting>
Some important things to note are that you want to boot from the cdrom, and you do NOT want the ne2000
card configured initially.  (We'll add that later...)
</para>

<para>
At this point, Bochs is ready to roll!  Insert the OSR5 install CD into the drive, and start Bochs.
You should soon see the SCO "boot:" prompt:
<screen>
SCO OpenServer(TM) Release 5

boot
: defbootstr disable=fdi,dptr
</screen>

Note the disable= parameter that you need.  These two SCO drivers cause the install to fail, so they
need to be disabled for the install boot.  You will not need this once OSR5 is installed.
</para>

<para>
During the install of OSR5, there are two default configuration answers that need to be changed.
For the hard disk setup, you should turn bad tracking off, since it's unnecessary on an emulated disk.
(It won't hurt to do it, it will just take a VERY long time!)
For the network setup, change the network card to Deferred.  You can change other settings, if you so
desire.  However, I would do the initial install with as little configured as you can get away with, then
add whatever else is needed (one step at a time) after the initial install completes.
</para>

<para>
Let the install copy the files.  Go get lunch.  Take a nap.  Go have dinner...
This can take a LONG time.  On my Pentium 4 1.7GHz system, this
step took just over eight hours!  (BTW, it was MUCH longer in version 1.4.1.  Great job, guys!)
</para>

<para>
After the install finishes, you will need to change the following lines in .bochsrc file:
<programlisting>
ne2k: ioaddr=0x300, irq=10, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=linux, ethdev=eth0
boot: disk
</programlisting>
Obviously, if you're not using Linux, the ethmode and ethdev values on the ne2k line will be different.
Also, since Bochs uses "raw" network card access, you'll have to "setuid root" on the Bochs executable:
<screen>
linux-$ chown root bochs
linux-$ chmod u+s bochs
</screen>
(If there is a way to give a "normal user" CAP_NET_RAW capability, that would be an alternative.
I don't know how to do that...)
Restart Bochs.  Now, you can just press Enter at the OSR5 boot: prompt, because the offending
drivers have been linked out of the kernel.
</para>

<para>
Before you configure the network card,  I'd strongly suggest getting the latest "nat" driver from SCO.
Version 5.0.5b of this driver, according to the SCO web site, "correct[s] possible system lockup
under high load due to internal buffer overflow."  The driver can be found
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.caldera.com/pub/openserver5/drivers/OSR505/network/nat">here</ulink>.
To get the Disk Image file into SCO, I downloaded the VOL.000.000 file to my linux box,
and used tar to get it on to a floppy:
<screen>
linux-$ tar -cvf /dev/fd0 VOL.000.000
</screen>
I then used tar within OSR5 to move it from the floppy to the /tmp directory:
<screen>
osr5-# cd /tmp
osr5-# tar -xvf /dev/fd0135ds18
</screen>
You can then use 'custom' to install the driver from the image file.
You will then want to use 'scoadmin network' to configure the network card.  Choose
the Novell NE2000 card, and set the parameters to match the ne2k: line in the .bochsrc file.
DO NOT have OSR5 look for the card, as Bochs may likely crash. (It did in version 1.4.1.)
</para>

<para>
You can also configure a printer, if you want.  Using the spoolpipe utility that I wrote
(which can be found in Bochs' misc directory), you can print from OSR5 through the parallel
port, and you'll hardly notice
that the printing is going through an extra layer of operating system!
(You could also set up a printer using network printing, if the printer is not on the host machine...)
