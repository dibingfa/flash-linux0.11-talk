>The <B

used by many software projects that reads the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

directory and follows the instructions that it finds there.  A <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> tells
which files depend on which other files, what commands to use to compile and
link the code, and more.  After you have finished the configure step, just type
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> to build the source code.  </P
><P
>The reason that make is so popular is that it is smart about when to compile
and when not to compile.  If you run make once, it compiles every file.  But
when you run it again, it checks to see if any source files have been modified;
if not, there's nothing to do!  For example, the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> says that
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>main.o</TT
> depends on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>main.cc</TT
>.  Knowing 
this, it will only compile <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>main.o</TT
>.</P
><P
>Of course, make can only do the right thing if the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> lists all the
dependencies correctly, so human error can sometimes lead make astray.
If make refuses to build something that you think it should, or you 
are getting strange compile errors, try doing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make all-clean</B
>
and then <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> again.  All-clean means to clean up
the compiled files in every subdirectory, while <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make clean</B
>
means to clean up just the current directory<A
NAME="AEN881"
HREF="#FTN.AEN881"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"
>[2]</SPAN
></A
>.  However, it's important to note that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make
all-clean</B
> leaves the configuration intact.  You do not have
to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B
> again.</P
><P
>If you're really in the mood for cleaning, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make dist-clean</B
>
erases all the configuration information too.  In theory, after a dist-clean
your directory should look much like when you first untarred it or checked it
out.  There's usually some extra stuff lying around, but the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> tries
at least to erase any files that it created.</P

>The standard compile uses the configure script, but the Windows platform
cannot run the configure script natively.
The current solution to this problem is that the Bochs
configure script must be run on a different platform that does support
shell scripts, with options that cause it to configure for a Win32 
platform instead of the native one.  Many people have access to a UNIX
machine that could run the configure script, or you can use Cygwin to
run the configure script
<A
NAME="AEN1243"
HREF="#FTN.AEN1243"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"

></A
>.</P
><P
>Download the Bochs sources on a machine that can run shell scripts.
Edit the configure shortcut script <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.conf.win32-vcpp</TT
>
if you want to adjust the configure options.  Then type these commands
in the Bochs source directory:
<TABLE

><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>  sh .conf.win32-vcpp
  make win32_snap</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
These commands will run the configure step, produce VC++ makefiles and 
workspace files, and pack it all into a .zip file in the directory above the
source directory <A
NAME="AEN1248"
HREF="#FTN.AEN1248"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"
>[5]</SPAN
></A
>.  The .zip file is all ready to transfer to the target Windows
machine to be unzipped and compiled.  Or, if you run the sh/make steps in
Cygwin, you are already on the target machine so you don't need the .zip
file.</P
><P
>When you have the Win32 sources transferred to a Windows machine with VC++,

><P
>Using workspaces is easy and intuitive, but there is one caveat.  The
workspaces come directly out of a ZIP file in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>build/win32/workspace.zip</TT
>, and they are not controlled by
the configure script.  When you compile with certain configure options (e.g.
--with-sdl) you need to link with additional libraries.  For now you must
add them to the VC++ workspace by hand.  In version 2.0, we have improved 
the situation considerably by adding #if...#endif around every optional file
and including nearly every Bochs source file in the workspace.  This solves the
problem of having to manually add source files to the workspace when you turn
on configure options such as --enable-debugger.  The problem of adding
link libraries remains unresolved.</P

  The protocol used between a VNC server and a VNC viewer is called RFB.
  Because the RFB code in Bochs is written with portable network socket
  and POSIX thread code, it can be compiled on many platforms and has
  been tested in Linux and Win32. No additional libraries are required.

><P
>  Dave Poirier has written an SDL interface for Bochs. Simple DirectMedia
  Layer, or SDL, is a cross-platform multimedia library distributed from
  <A
HREF="http://libsdl.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>libsdl.org</A
>. SDL is available
  for many platforms including Win32, Linux, BSD, IRIX, MacOS, MacOS X, BeOS,
  and AmigaOS.</P
><P
>  To compile Bochs with SDL, you must first install the SDL library
  from <A
HREF="http://libsdl.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>libsdl.org</A
>. You
  can either get the source code and compile it yourself, or install
  the development libraries for your platform (already compiled).
  Then, go into the Bochs directory and type:
<TABLE

><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>  configure --with-sdl
  make</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>  If you are on FreeBSD and have SDL installed using the ports collection, Bochs
  won't be able to find the library automatically, as the SDL config script is
  called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sdl11-config</TT
> in that case (even for version 1.2).
  The easiest way to make Bochs find it, is to create a symlink to that script
  called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sdl-config</TT
> inside a directory which is in the path.
  For example:
<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>- On a machine that can run shell scripts, such as Cygwin, run
    configure --target=pentium-windows --with-sdl
    make win32_snap
- Copy the resulting ZIP file to your Windows box and unzip it.
- Load up workspace called bochs.dsw in VC++ 6.0
- Double click "gui files"
- Remove gui/win32.cpp from the project, and add gui/sdl.cpp instead.
- Edit the settings of "gui files".  Under C/C++ tab, category=preprocessor,
  additional include directories, add the directory where SDL/SDL.h can be
  found.
- Edit the settings of the "bochs files" project.  Under the Link tab,
  category=General, add SDL.lib to object/library modules list.  Then in
  category=Input, add the path of SDL.lib to additional library path.  Click
  ok.
- Select Build:Build Bochs.exe</PRE

>RPM stands for "RedHat Package Manager."  An RPM is a compressed file
containing files to be installed on your system.  Bochs 
has a special shell script called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make-rpm</TT
> that helps
to build an RPM of Bochs.  Start with a clean source directory.  Edit
.conf.linux first if you want to adjust the configure options.  
Then, type:

When this command completes, you should have a source RPM and a binary RPM of
Bochs in the current directory.  The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tee</B

command (optional) saves a transcript of the build process into /tmp/build.txt,
which is very useful if anything goes wrong.  Instructions for installing an
RPM are <A

>what if configure fails?
- tar up config.* and send to bochs-testing@tlw.com
- report the problem with a source forge bug report.

what if make fails?
- try make dist-clean, and run configure and make again
- use configure options to disable options.  For example, if errors in 
fpu/fpu.cc, you could try --disable-fpu.
- search for the error on the Bochs website (bug reports, patches)
- if familiar with C++, many minor problems can be corrected
- move to more stable code.  if it's CVS, see if a release version will
  compile.  Report problem to bochs-developers.
- report the problem with a source forge bug report.</PRE
