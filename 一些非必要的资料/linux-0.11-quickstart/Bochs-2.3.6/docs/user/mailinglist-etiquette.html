>Here are a few guidelines for use of the Bochs mailing lists:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Please check the documentation before asking questions, but on this list you
are very UNLIKELY to get flamed and insulted for being a Bochs beginner.
Sending commercial promotions to the list probably will get you some angry
responses though.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If you are having difficulty finding what you are looking for, try doing a search on <A
HREF="http://www.google.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Google</A
>.  If you are searching for Bochs options, for example, you can use this syntax in the Google search box:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>configuration options site:bochs.sourceforge.net</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
For best results, be sure not to put a space between "site:" and "bochs.sourceforge.net".  Be sure to look at more than the first item on the search results.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If you still cannot find what you are looking for, be sure you are prepared when you post your question, and post in the right forum.  Be sure you include important details, such as the operating system and version of your host, and what it is you are trying to do.   If you are getting errors or something is not working, summarize what you checked and what you changed.  This will help isolate the problem.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Bochs is for everyone.  If you are an experienced Bochs user or developer and are helping someone else, be considerate of the other person's feelings.  We share a common interest, and we need to encourage each other and be supportive.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Also, keep in mind that messages are limited to 40K, so if you want to share a
large screen shot or disk image, put it on a web or FTP site and tell people
how to find it.  Patches are usually small enough that they aren't a problem,
especially if compressed.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Distribution of copyrighted material, or even offers to distribute copyrighted
material WILL NOT be tolerated.  The Bochs Project does not distribute
any software (disk images) in violation of the license agreement, and users who
do so will be warned first and then blocked from the list if it happens again.
As an open source project, we rely on donated services from Source Forge and
other groups, and we can't afford to put them or ourselves at risk of legal
action.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It is possible to subscribe and unsubscribe by email.  If you do this, you must
write to bochs-announce-request or bochs-developers-request.  Don't forget the
"-request" part or your subscribe message will go to 300+ people.</P
