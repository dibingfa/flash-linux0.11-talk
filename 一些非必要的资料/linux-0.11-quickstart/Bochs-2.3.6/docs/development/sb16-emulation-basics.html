>Right now, MPU401 emulation is next to perfect. It supports UART
and SBMIDI mode, because the SB16's MPU401 ports can't do anything else as well.</P
><P
>The digital audio basically works, but the emulation is too slow for fluent
output unless the application doesn't do much in the background (or the
foreground, really). The sound tends to looping or crackle on slower
computer, but the emulation appears to be correct. Even a MOD
player works, although only for lower sampling speeds.</P
><P
>Also, the MIDI data running through the MPU401 ports can be written
into a SMF, that is the standard midi file. The wave output
can be written into a VOC file, which has a format defined by
Creative Labs. This file format can be converted to WAV by
sox for example.</P

></H2

>Output is supported on Linux and Windows 95 at the moment.
On Linux, the output goes to any file or device. If you have a
wavetable synthesizer, midi can go to /dev/midi00, otherwise you may need
a midi interpreter. For example, the midid program from the
DosEmu project would work. Wave output should go to /dev/dsp.
These devices are assumed to be OSS devices, if they're not
some of the ioctl's might fail.
On Windows, midi and output goes to the midi mapper and the wave mapper,
respectively. A future version might have selectable output devices.</P
