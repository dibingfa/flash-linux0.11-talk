# your pathname includes spaces.

#=======================================================================
# CONFIG_INTERFACE
#
# The configuration interface is a series of menus or dialog boxes that
# allows you to change all the settings that control Bochs's behavior.
# There are two choices of configuration interface: a text mode version
# called "textconfig" and a graphical version called "wx".  The text
# mode version uses stdin/stdout and is always compiled in.  The graphical
# version is only available when you use "--with-wx" on the configure 
# command.  If you do not write a config_interface line, Bochs will 
# choose a default for you.
#
# NOTE: if you use the "wx" configuration interface, you must also use
# the "wx" display library.
#=======================================================================
#config_interface: textconfig
#config_interface: wx

#=======================================================================
# DISPLAY_LIBRARY
#
# The display library is the code that displays the Bochs VGA screen.  Bochs 
# has a selection of about 10 different display library implementations for 
# different platforms.  If you run configure with multiple --with-* options, 
# the display_library command lets you choose which one you want to run with.
# If you do not write a display_library line, Bochs will choose a default for
# you.
#
# The choices are: 
#   x              use X windows interface, cross platform
#   win32          use native win32 libraries
#   carbon         use Carbon library (for MacOS X)
#   beos           use native BeOS libraries
#   macintosh      use MacOS pre-10
#   amigaos        use native AmigaOS libraries
#   sdl            use SDL library, cross platform
#   svga           use SVGALIB library for Linux, allows graphics without X11
#   term           text only, uses curses/ncurses library, cross platform
#   rfb            provides an interface to AT&T's VNC viewer, cross platform
#   wx             use wxWidgets library, cross platform
#   nogui          no display at all
#
# NOTE: if you use the "wx" configuration interface, you must also use
# the "wx" display library.
#
# Specific options:
# Some display libraries now support specific option to control their
# behaviour. See the examples below for currently supported options.

# ROMIMAGE:
# The ROM BIOS controls what the PC does when it first powers on.
# Normally, you can use a precompiled BIOS in the source or binary
# distribution called BIOS-bochs-latest. The ROM BIOS is usually loaded
# starting at address 0xf0000, and it is exactly 64k long. Another option
# is 128k BIOS which is loaded at address 0xe0000.
# You can also use the environment variable $BXSHARE to specify the
# location of the BIOS.
# The usage of external large BIOS images (up to 512k) at memory top is
# now supported, but we still recommend to use the BIOS distributed with
# Bochs. Now the start address can be calculated from image size.
#=======================================================================
romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest 
#romimage: file=mybios.bin, address=0xfff80000 # 512k at memory top

#=======================================================================
# CPU:
# This defines cpu-related parameters inside Bochs:
#
#  COUNT:
#  Set the number of processors:cores per processor:threads per core 
#  when Bochs is compiled for SMP emulation.
#  Bochs currently supports up to 8 threads running simultaniosly. 
#  If Bochs is compiled without SMP support, it won't accept values 
#  different from 1.
#
#  QUANTUM:
#  Maximum amount of instructions allowed to execute by processor before
#  returning control to another cpu. This option exists only in Bochs 
#  binary compiled with SMP support.
#
#  RESET_ON_TRIPLE_FAULT:
#  Reset the CPU when triple fault occur (highly recommended) rather than
#  PANIC. Remember that if you trying to continue after triple fault the 
#  simulation will be completely bogus !
#
#  IPS:
#  Emulated Instructions Per Second.  This is the number of IPS that bochs
#  is capable of running on your machine. You can recompile Bochs with
#  --enable-show-ips option enabled, to find your workstation's capability.
#  Measured IPS value will then be logged into your log file or status bar
#  (if supported by the gui).
#
#  IPS is used to calibrate many time-dependent events within the bochs 
#  simulation.  For example, changing IPS affects the frequency of VGA
#  updates, the duration of time before a key starts to autorepeat, and
#  the measurement of BogoMips and other benchmarks.
#
#  Examples:
#
#  Bochs Machine/Compiler                                 Mips
# ____________________________________________________________________

#   
# Point this at a hard disk image file, cdrom iso file, or physical cdrom
# device.  To create a hard disk image, try running bximage.  It will help you
# choose the size and then suggest a line that works with it.
#
# In UNIX it may be possible to use a raw device as a Bochs hard disk, 
# but WE DON'T RECOMMEND IT.  In Windows there is no easy way.
#
# In windows, the drive letter + colon notation should be used for cdroms.
# Depending on versions of windows and drivers, you may only be able to 
# access the "first" cdrom in the system.  On MacOSX, use path="drive"
# to access the physical drive.
#
# The path is always mandatory. Disk geometry autodetection works with images
# created by bximage if CHS is set to 0/0/0 (cylinders are calculated using
# heads=16 and spt=63). For other hard disk images and modes the cylinders,
# heads, and spt are mandatory.
#
# Default values are:

# LOG CONTROLS
#
# Bochs now has four severity levels for event logging.
#   panic: cannot proceed.  If you choose to continue after a panic, 
#          don't be surprised if you get strange behavior or crashes.
#   error: something went wrong, but it is probably safe to continue the
#          simulation.
#   info: interesting or useful messages.
#   debug: messages useful only when debugging the code.  This may
#          spit out thousands per second.
#
# For events of each level, you can choose to crash, report, or ignore.
# TODO: allow choice based on the facility: e.g. crash on panics from
#       everything except the cdrom, and only report those.
#
# If you are experiencing many panics, it can be helpful to change
# the panic action to report instead of fatal.  However, be aware
# that anything executed after a panic is uncharted territory and can 
# cause bochs to become unstable.  The panic is a "graceful exit," so
# if you disable it you may get a spectacular disaster instead.
#=======================================================================
panic: action=ask
error: action=report
info: action=report

#=======================================================================
# COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4:
# This defines a serial port (UART type 16550A). In the 'term' you can specify
# a device to use as com1. This can be a real serial line, or a pty.  To use
# a pty (under X/Unix), create two windows (xterms, usually).  One of them will
# run bochs, and the other will act as com1. Find out the tty the com1
# window using the `tty' command, and use that as the `dev' parameter.
# Then do `sleep 1000000' in the com1 window to keep the shell from
# messing with things, and run bochs in the other window.  Serial I/O to
# com1 (port 0x3f8) will all go to the other window.
# Other serial modes are 'null' (no input/output), 'file' (output to a file
# specified as the 'dev' parameter), 'raw' (use the real serial port - under
# construction for win32), 'mouse' (standard serial mouse - requires
# mouse option setting 'type=serial', 'type=serial_wheel' or 'type=serial_msys')
# and 'socket' (connect a networking socket).
#
# Examples:
#   com1: enabled=1, mode=null
#   com1: enabled=1, mode=mouse
#   com2: enabled=1, mode=file, dev=serial.out
#   com3: enabled=1, mode=raw, dev=com1

#=======================================================================
#com1: enabled=1, mode=term, dev=/dev/ttyp9


#=======================================================================
# PARPORT1, PARPORT2:
# This defines a parallel (printer) port. When turned on and an output file is
# defined the emulated printer port sends characters printed by the guest OS
# into the output file. On some platforms a device filename can be used to
# send the data to the real parallel port (e.g. "/dev/lp0" on Linux, "lpt1" on
# win32 platforms).
#
# Examples:
#   parport1: enabled=1, file="parport.out"
#   parport2: enabled=1, file="/dev/lp0"
#   parport1: enabled=0
#=======================================================================
parport1: enabled=1, file="parport.out"

#=======================================================================
# SB16:
# This defines the SB16 sound emulation. It can have several of the
# following properties.
# All properties are in the format sb16: property=value
# midi: The filename is where the midi data is sent. This can be a
#       device or just a file if you want to record the midi data.
# midimode:
#      0=no data
#      1=output to device (system dependent. midi denotes the device driver)
#      2=SMF file output, including headers
#      3=output the midi data stream to the file (no midi headers and no
#        delta times, just command and data bytes)
# wave: This is the device/file where wave output is stored
# wavemode:
#      0=no data
#      1=output to device (system dependent. wave denotes the device driver)
#      2=VOC file output, incl. headers
#      3=output the raw wave stream to the file
# log:  The file to write the sb16 emulator messages to.
# loglevel:
#      0=no log
#      1=resource changes, midi program and bank changes
#      2=severe errors
#      3=all errors
#      4=all errors plus all port accesses
#      5=all errors and port accesses plus a lot of extra info
# dmatimer:
#      microseconds per second for a DMA cycle.  Make it smaller to fix
#      non-continuous sound.  750000 is usually a good value.  This needs a
#      reasonably correct setting for the IPS parameter of the CPU option.
#
# For an example look at the next line:

#sb16: midimode=1, midi=/dev/midi00, wavemode=1, wave=/dev/dsp, loglevel=2, log=sb16.log, dmatimer=600000

#=======================================================================
# VGA_UPDATE_INTERVAL:
# Video memory is scanned for updates and screen updated every so many
# virtual seconds.  The default is 40000, about 25Hz. Keep in mind that
# you must tweak the 'cpu: ips=N' directive to be as close to the number
# of emulated instructions-per-second your workstation can do, for this
# to be accurate.
#
# Examples:
#   vga_update_interval: 250000

vga_update_interval: 300000

# using for Winstone '98 tests
#vga_update_interval:  100000

#=======================================================================
# KEYBOARD_SERIAL_DELAY:
# Approximate time in microseconds that it takes one character to
# be transfered from the keyboard to controller over the serial path.
# Examples:
#   keyboard_serial_delay: 200
#=======================================================================
keyboard_serial_delay: 250

#=======================================================================
# KEYBOARD_PASTE_DELAY:
# Approximate time in microseconds between attempts to paste
# characters to the keyboard controller. This leaves time for the
# guest os to deal with the flow of characters.  The ideal setting
# depends on how your operating system processes characters.  The
# default of 100000 usec (.1 seconds) was chosen because it works 
# consistently in Windows.
#
# If your OS is losing characters during a paste, increase the paste
# delay until it stops losing characters.
#
# Examples:
#   keyboard_paste_delay: 100000

# MOUSE: 
# This option prevents Bochs from creating mouse "events" unless a mouse
# is  enabled. The hardware emulation itself is not disabled by this.
# You can turn the mouse on by setting enabled to 1, or turn it off by
# setting enabled to 0. Unless you have a particular reason for enabling
# the mouse by default, it is recommended that you leave it off.
# You can also toggle the mouse usage at runtime (control key + middle
# mouse button on X11, SDL, wxWidgets and Win32).
# With the mouse type option you can select the type of mouse to emulate.
# The default value is 'ps2'. The other choices are 'imps2' (wheel mouse
# on PS/2), 'serial', 'serial_wheel' and 'serial_msys' (one com port requires
# setting 'mode=mouse'). To connect a mouse to an USB port, see the 'usb1'
# option (requires PCI and USB support).
#
# Examples:
#   mouse: enabled=1
#   mouse: enabled=1, type=imps2
#   mouse: enabled=1, type=serial
#   mouse: enabled=0
#=======================================================================
mouse: enabled=0

# private_colormap: Request that the GUI create and use it's own
#                   non-shared colormap.  This colormap will be used
#                   when in the bochs window.  If not enabled, a
#                   shared colormap scheme may be used.  Not implemented
#                   on all GUI's.
#
# Examples:
#   private_colormap: enabled=1
#   private_colormap: enabled=0
#=======================================================================
private_colormap: enabled=0

#=======================================================================
# fullscreen: ONLY IMPLEMENTED ON AMIGA
#             Request that Bochs occupy the entire screen instead of a 
#             window.
#
# Examples:
#   fullscreen: enabled=0
#   fullscreen: enabled=1
#=======================================================================
#fullscreen: enabled=0

# ne2k: NE2000 compatible ethernet adapter
#
# Examples:
# ne2k: ioaddr=IOADDR, irq=IRQ, mac=MACADDR, ethmod=MODULE, ethdev=DEVICE, script=SCRIPT
#
# ioaddr, irq: You probably won't need to change ioaddr and irq, unless there
# are IRQ conflicts.
#
# mac: The MAC address MUST NOT match the address of any machine on the net.
# Also, the first byte must be an even number (bit 0 set means a multicast
# address), and you cannot use ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff because that's the broadcast
# address.  For the ethertap module, you must use fe:fd:00:00:00:01.  There may
# be other restrictions too.  To be safe, just use the b0:c4... address.
#
# ethdev: The ethdev value is the name of the network interface on your host
# platform.  On UNIX machines, you can get the name by running ifconfig.  On
# Windows machines, you must run niclist to get the name of the ethdev.
# Niclist source code is in misc/niclist.c and it is included in Windows 
# binary releases.
#
# script: The script value is optional, and is the name of a script that 
# is executed after bochs initialize the network interface. You can use 
# this script to configure this network interface, or enable masquerading.
# This is mainly useful for the tun/tap devices that only exist during
# Bochs execution. The network interface name is supplied to the script
# as first parameter
#
# If you don't want to make connections to any physical networks,
# you can use the following 'ethmod's to simulate a virtual network.
#   null: All packets are discarded, but logged to a few files.
#   arpback: ARP is simulated. Disabled by default.
#   vde:  Virtual Distributed Ethernet
#   vnet: ARP, ICMP-echo(ping), DHCP and read/write TFTP are simulated.
#         The virtual host uses 192.168.10.1.
#         DHCP assigns 192.168.10.2 to the guest.
#         TFTP uses the ethdev value for the root directory and doesn't
#         overwrite files.

# KEYBOARD_MAPPING:
# This enables a remap of a physical localized keyboard to a 
# virtualized us keyboard, as the PC architecture expects.
# If enabled, the keymap file must be specified.
# 
# Examples:
#   keyboard_mapping: enabled=1, map=gui/keymaps/x11-pc-de.map
#=======================================================================
keyboard_mapping: enabled=0, map=

#=======================================================================
# KEYBOARD_TYPE:
# Type of keyboard return by a "identify keyboard" command to the
# keyboard controler. It must be one of "xt", "at" or "mf".
# Defaults to "mf". It should be ok for almost everybody. A known
# exception is french macs, that do have a "at"-like keyboard.
#
# Examples:
#   keyboard_type: mf
#=======================================================================
#keyboard_type: mf

#=======================================================================
# USER_SHORTCUT:
# This defines the keyboard shortcut to be sent when you press the "user"
# button in the headerbar. The shortcut string is a combination of maximum
# 3 key names (listed below) separated with a '-' character. The old-style
# syntax (without the '-') still works for the key combinations supported
# in Bochs 2.2.1.
# Valid key names:
# "alt", "bksl", "bksp", "ctrl", "del", "down", "end", "enter", "esc",
# "f1", ... "f12", "home", "ins", "left", "menu", "minus", "pgdwn", "pgup",
# "plus", "right", "shift", "space", "tab", "up", "win" and "print".
#
# Example:
#   user_shortcut: keys=ctrl-alt-del
#=======================================================================
#user_shortcut: keys=ctrl-alt-del

#=======================================================================
# I440FXSUPPORT:
# This option controls the presence of the i440FX PCI chipset. You can
# also specify the devices connected to PCI slots. Up to 5 slots are
# available now. These devices are currently supported: ne2k, pcivga,
# pcidev and pcipnic. If Bochs is compiled with Cirrus SVGA support
# you'll have the additional choice 'cirrus'.
#
# Example:
#   i440fxsupport: enabled=1, slot1=pcivga, slot2=ne2k
#=======================================================================
i440fxsupport: enabled=1

#=======================================================================
# USB1:
# This option controls the presence of the USB root hub which is a part
# of the i440FX PCI chipset. With the portX option you can connect devices
# to the hub (currently supported: 'mouse', 'tablet', 'keypad' and 'disk').
# If you connect the mouse or tablet to one of the ports, Bochs forwards the
# mouse movement data to the USB device instead of the selected mouse type.
# When connecting the keypad to one of the ports, Bochs forwards the input of
# the numeric keypad to the USB device instead of the PS/2 keyboard.
# To connect a flat image as an USB hardisk you can use the 'disk' device with
# the path to the image separated with a colon (see below).
#=======================================================================
#usb1: enabled=1
#usb1: enabled=1, port1=mouse, port2=disk:usbdisk.img

#=======================================================================
# CMOSIMAGE:
# This defines image file that can be loaded into the CMOS RAM at startup.
# The rtc_init parameter controls whether initialize the RTC with values stored
# in the image. By default the time0 argument given to the clock option is used.
# With 'rtc_init=image' the image is the source for the initial time.
#
# Example:
#   cmosimage: file=cmos.img, rtc_init=image
#=======================================================================
#cmosimage: file=cmos.img, rtc_init=time0

#=======================================================================
# MAGIC_BREAK:
# This enables the "magic breakpoint" feature when using the debugger.
# The useless cpu instruction XCHG BX, BX causes Bochs to enter the
# debugger mode. This might be useful for software development.

# Example:
#   magic_break: enabled=1
