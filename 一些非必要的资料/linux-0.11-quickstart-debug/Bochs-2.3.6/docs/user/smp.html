>Bochs can now simulate an SMP machine when you use "--enable-smp" in the
configure command.  SMP support was added by Bryce Denney, who
was very interested in watching a multiprocessor operating system work 
at a low level.  It should also be helpful to operating system developers
who are writing SMP drivers, or just for users who want to test drive
an SMP machine to see what it looks like.</P
><P
>Starting with Bochs 2.2.6 you can set up the number of processors in the
<TT

>. See <A
HREF="bochsrc.html#BOCHSOPT-CPU"
>Section 4.2.2</A
> how to
set up the number of processors.</P
><P
>It is important to understand that configuring bochs for 4 processors will NOT
make your single-threaded applications run faster in general!  On the contrary,
it has to spend time simulating idle processors as well as the ones doing your
task.  The point is to simulate an SMP system, not to speed up a uniprocessor
application.</P

> a data structure called the Intel Multiprocessor Configuration
must be present in BIOS memory space. An SMP-aware operating system probes BIOS
memory to find the structure, which contains information about how many
processors, their IDs, interrupt sources, etc. Starting with Bochs 2.2.5 these
structures are dynamicly created by Bochs.</P

> ACPI support is required to boot SMP system in most of modern
operating systems. For example WinXP 64 bit require ACPI support even for 
single processor configuration. Still not supported by Bochs. (FIXME)</P

implemented yet and cause a panic.  If you boot linux 2.4.3 for 
example, it says "panic: cluster model addressing not implemented".</P

><P
>A number of people have suggested using threads to simulate each CPU in
a different thread.  Then on a real SMP machine, the threads can execute
in parallel.  This is a great idea, but it's not done at present.</P
