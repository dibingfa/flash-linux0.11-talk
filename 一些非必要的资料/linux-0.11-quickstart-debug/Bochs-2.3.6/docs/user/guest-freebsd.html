>      This is just a very short step-by-step installation guide for FreeBSD in Bochs. It
      doesn't explain what you do nor why you do it, it just tells you how to do it.
      For in-deepth information refer to the FreeBSD handbook:
      <A
HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/install.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Installing FreeBSD</A
>.
    </P
><P
>      FreeBSD boots up and shows a nice (text-mode) boot option screen. Just press
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>return</B
> there, that is, use the default option. After loading the
      kernel and needed device drivers, select 'Standard' in the installation menu.
    </P
><P
>      A fdisk like partition program is loaded next, where you just press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>A</B
>
      to use the entire disk, followed by <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Q</B
> to finish the selection. The next
      dialog asks for the boot manager you want to use. Select 'Standard' and continue.
    </P
><P
>      In the Disklabel Editor, you have to setup the layout of your partition. If your (virtual)
      hard disk is large enough, you can press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>A</B
> for auto-layout. However, you
      need to make sure that the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
> partition is at least
      250M large, or you will end up with a 'disk full' error message during installation. If
      this is not the case, select one partition after another and press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>D</B
> to
      delete it again. After you deleted all partitions, create two new ones. The first one will
      be a swap partition; press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>C</B
>, enter '32M' as size and select 'Swap' from
      the dialog. Press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>C</B
> again, and accept the remaining capacity for your
      filesystem partition. Choose 'FS' as partition type and enter '/' (slash) as mount point.
      Your partition layout is complete now; press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Q</B
> to leave the editor.

      <DIV

CLASS="NOTE"

><B
>Note: </B
>        This 'all-in-one' partition layout is not recommended for a FreeBSD installation on a
        real box; use 'auto-layout' or something comparable to that there.
      </P

    </P
><P
>      You now can choose what set of programs/files (distribution) you want to install. Take
      'User' (option 8), and select 'No' when asked to install the ports collection. You are
      back in the distribution selection, where you select the first item, called 'Exit'.
      Choose to install from 'CD/DVD' and answer the 'Are you sure?' dialog with 'yes'.

><P
>      All files are installed on your (virtual) hard disk now, and FreeBSD is ready for getting set
      up. As this is a very basic FreeBSD installation, you just answer 'no' to nearly all questions,
      but the one about your mouse: Answer 'yes' for PS/2 mouse, and choose 'Exit' at mouse configuration.
      The miniinst FreeBSD ISO image contains nearly no binary packages, so don't browse the package
      collection. Then, when asked to create a new user account, answer 'yes' and create a new user
      called 'bochs' (or whatever you like). You might want to use <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin/csh</TT
>
      or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin/tcsh</TT
> as shell rather than <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin/sh</TT
>. Next,
      you are asked for the super user (root) password. The installation is finished now, there is
      no need to visit the general configuration menu again - answer 'no' to that question. FreeBSD
      will then reboot. Shutdown Bochs, as soon as the (virtual) computer boots.

      boot process.

>      Your keyboard might use the wrong keymap, so login (into FreeBSD) as super user and use

      'keymap' and select the keymap you want to use.

      image, before you start playing around.
