I2C-BUS DEVICES			Release 61		Last Change 16jul00
Copyright (c) 1997,1998,1999,2000 Ralf Brown

--------!---Note-----------------------------
Notes:	An I2C device uses two consecutive subaddresses; the low bit indicates
	  whether a read (bit 0 = 1) or write (bit 0 = 0) is being performed
	the header of each entry in this file indicates the device's subaddress
	  (the "slave address" in official terminology) and the register number
	  within the device; for certain indexed registers, the index value is
	  given as the third value in the entry header
	SMBus, ACCESS.bus, and the DDC2B data link to the monitor are all
	  variants of the I2C bus, and are thus listed here as well.
	unless otherwise noted, all device registers are eight bits in size,
	  and may be both read and written
	the access method for communicating with an I2C device is
	  implementation-dependent; for example, recent S3 chipsets supporting
	  the "Scenic Highway" Local Peripheral Bus access the I2C bus via
	  bit-banging of memory-mapped I/O register FF20h
	  (see MEM A000h:FF00h"S3").  On the Zoran ZR36057 used by the
	  Miro DC-30, the I2C bus is accessed by bit-banging memory-mapped
	  register 17 (at offset 0x44).	 On the Cirrus Logic GD7556, extended
	  sequencer register 8 is used (see #P0677).
	maximum data rates on the I2C bus are also device-dependent; typical
	  maximum rates are 80 kHz (DIMMs), 100 kHz (VPX3220A), and 400 kHz.
	in DDC (Dislay Data Channel) 2B, the monitor's EDID info appears to be
	  stored in an EEPROM at the standard bus address of A0h; access to
	  the DDC clock/data lines is, however, chipset-specific.  On S3's
	  Trio64V+, the DDC lines share a port with the LPB's I2C bus: when the
	  feature connector is disabled, they are connected to the monitor;
	  when enabled, the lines are connected to the Local Peripheral Bus

I2C A0h - EEPROM (Xicor X24C01A, etc.)
Access:	Read/Write
Range:	I2C addresses A0h,A2h,A4h,...,AEh, depending on external pin inputs
Notes:	the I2C specification defines bus addresses Axh for use by memory
	  devices (EEPROMs, etc.)
	in general, any byte of an EEPROM may be written by sending a three-
	  byte I2C telegram consisting of the bus address, the byte address
	  within the device, and the new value for that memory location
	for the X24C01A and other devices, an entire page may be written with
	  a single telegram by writing the bus address, start address of the
	  page, and one page's worth of data bytes
	in general, EEPROMs maintain a current-location pointer, so that
	  any reads start at that location within the device and increment
	  the pointer for each byte read; random reads are possible by writing
	  the desired new address to the EEPROM (i.e. perform a write as though
	  setting a memory location, but either terminate the telegram or send
	  a repeated start condition after the address byte)
	after a write, the X24C01A and most other EEPROMs will no longer ACK
	  telegrams directed at the device until the internal write cycle is
	  completed, which may take several milliseconds

I2C A0h - VESA DDC monitor's EDID EEPROM
Note:	access to the DDC clock/data lines is chipset-specific.	 On S3's

	  feature connector is disabled, they are connected to the monitor
	  as well to the Local Peripheral Bus' serial port lines

Notes:	the I2C specification defines bus addresses Axh for use by memory

	  430TX and 440LX chipsets use the SMBus software interface to I2C to
	  access the SPD (can anyone verify this?)

I2C C0h - Philips TSA5522/TSA5523M Frequency Synthesizer - SET TUNER FREQUENCY
Access:	Write
Size:	4 BYTEs
Range:	I2C addresses C0h, C2h, C4h, or C6h, selectable by external pin
Desc:	the tuner is programmed by writing four bytes: high byte of Freq
	  (bit 7 must be 0), low byte of Freq, high byte of band (bit 7 must
	  be 1), and low byte of band.
Notes:	Freq is the 16 * (desired frequency in MHz + IF frequency), assuming
	  a reference divisor of 512; multiply by 20 or 32 for divisors 640
	  and 1024.  (IF = 47 [2Fh] typically)
	the FI1236MK2 is software-compatible with the TSA5523M
	the TSA5055T is also software-compatible, with the exception that the
	  step size is fixed at 125 kHz (for a 4MHz external crystal) in order
	  to provide a top frequency of 2.5 GHz
	the TSA5512 and TSA5515T are also software-compatible, with a step size
	  fixed at 62.5 kHz (with a 4MHz external crystal); on the 5515T, only
	  output ports P1, P2, and P7 are available
	because the high bits of the first and third data bytes distinguish
	  between frequency and control bytes, either half may be programmed
	  independently; when switching bands and the new frequency is less
	  than the current frequency, Philips recommends sending the control
	  bytes first to avoid unnecessary charge pump action which can push
	  the tuner into extreme states

I2C F8h - 10-bit addressing - Device addresses 0xxh
Desc:	in the new I2C standard, devices may have 10-bit addresses instead of
	  7-bit addresses.  Use of 10-bit addressing is indicated by generating
	  a bus address with the five high bits set; bits 2 and 1 then contain
	  the high two bits of the actual address and bit 0 is the read/write
	  bit as before.  The low 8 bits of the device address are then sent
	  in a second byte.

I2C xxh - Crystal Semiconductor CS4920/CS4920A/CS4921/CS4922
Desc:	the CS4920A and CS4922 are MPEG audio decoders
Note:	the address to which the CS4922 responds must be programmed via the
	  I2C bus; initially, the chip responds to any address
	after a reset, the 4922's DSP boot ROM expects to have the RAM loaded
	  with a microprogram by sending data over I2C (see #I0065)

Format of Crystal Semiconductor microprogram data:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table I0121)
 00h	WORD	starting address in RAM
		high three bits ignored; bit 12 indicates program/data memory
		the CS4920A contains 4K words of program RAM, 2K words data
		  RAM (of which the high 32 words are used by the debug prog.)
		the CS4922 contains 5K words of program RAM, 3K words data RAM
 02h	WORD	length of block of data
 04h 3N BYTEs	sequence of 24-bit words of code or data
	...	(above may be repeated arbitrarily often)
	WORD	FFFFh end marker
      3 BYTEs	24-bit checksum (sum of all previous bytes)
