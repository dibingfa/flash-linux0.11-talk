Found: Algorithm used by IBM in calculating CRC checksums for PS/2
       (see bytes 32h-33h). Complex (recursive part is 12 lines of
       assembly) and not yet validated for every model.
--------!---Note-----------------------------
			Background

The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) memory is actually 
a 64 or 128 byte battery-backed RAM memory module that is a part of the 
system clock chip. Some IBM PS/2 models have the capability for a
2k (2048 byte) CMOS ROM Extension.

First used with clock-calender cards for the IBM PC-XT, when the PC/AT
(Advanced Technology) was introduced in 1985, the Motorola MC146818 
became a part of the motherboard. Since the clock only uses fourteen of 
the RAM bytes, the rest are available for storing system configuration data.

Interestingly, the original IBM-PC/AT (Advanced Technology) standard for 
the region 10h-3Fh is nearly universal with one notable exception: The 
IBM PS/2 systems deviate considerably (Note: AMSTRAD 8086 machines were 
among the first to actively use the CMOS memory available and since they 
*predate* the AT, do not follow the AT standard).

This is just another example of how IBM created a standard, lost control 
of it, tried to replace it, failed and lost market share in the process. 

Originally, the IBM PC/AT only made use of a small portion of CMOS memory
and was defined in the IBM PC/AT Technical Reference Manual, specifically 
bytes 10h, 12h, 14h-18h, 2Eh-33h. The balance was left undefined but was 
quickly appropriated by various BIOS manufacturers for such user-selectable 
options such as wait states, clock speeds, initial boot drive selection, and 
password storage.

Later, as CMOS memory requirements grew, newer clock chips with 128
bytes of RAM came into use. However the fact remains that once the AT 
standard was established, only IBM has tried to change the definitions 
of that first description.

			Accessing the CMOS

The CMOS memory exists outside of the normal address space and cannot
contain directly executable code. It is reachable through IN and OUT
commands at port number 70h (112d) and 71h (113d). To read a CMOS byte,
an OUT to port 70h is executed with the address of the byte to be read and
an IN from port 71h will then retrieve the requested information. The 
following BASIC fragment will read 128 CMOS bytes and print them to the 
screen in 8 rows of 16 values.

The CMOS RAM space has an upper limit of 128 bytes because of the structure
of port 70: only bits 0-6 are used for addressing, bit 7 is used to 
enable (0) or disable (1) Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI) and explains why
IBM uses 80h OR <address> to read/write data & follows with  a "throw-away"
call.

Note that if the CMOS only has 64 bytes available, addressing will 
generally wrap and addresses from 40h-7Fh will mirror 00h-3Fh. Output will 
be hexadecimal.

10 CLS
20 FOR i = 0 TO &H7F 
30 OUT &H70, i
40 PRINT USING "\   \"; HEX$(INP(&H71));
50 NEXT i
60 PRINT " " 

Note: where not otherwise noted, all data points are expressed as BYTES
      these are eight bit values and are read from MSB to LSB e.g.
      0000 0000	    0101 1010 binary would be written as 5Ah
      7654 3210	    where only some bits are used this is represented with
		    Xs e.g bits 5-3 would be shown as 00xx x000

Note: the entries for AMI WinBIOS also apply to AMIBIOS with core dates of 
	12/15/95 or later


Newer BIOSes have two checksums in the CMOS RAM, the second one covering
bytes 40h through 7Ch (or 7Eh).  Unfortunately, the second checksum is at
a different location in different BIOSes.  The following code from 
Agapov Vasiliy Pavlovich <arhfond@online.ru> (28 Aug 1996) is designed to
find the location of the second checksum byte on *any* BIOS (successfully
tested on various versions of AMI and AWARD BIOSes).

Agapov's instructions for use:
> Before starting this code make sure to load the 128 bytes of CMOS data
> to the buffer at CMOS_DATA and assume DS as data area segment register.

		Organization of CMOS Memory - Clock

00h-0Eh is defined by the clock hardware and all must follow it.  Other 
manufacturers generally follow the same format as specified for the
region 10h - 2Fh. Some also follow the IBM format for 30h-33h but not all 
(Zenith in particular is different).

The first fourteen bytes are dedicated to the MC146818 chip clock functions 
and consist of ten read/write data registers and four status registers, two 
of which are read/write and two of which are read only.

The format of the ten clock data registers (bytes 00h-09h) is:

The following is the on-chip status register information. 

----------R0A--------------------------------
CMOS 0Ah - RTC - STATUS REGISTER A (read/write) (usu 26h)

Bitfields for Real-Time Clock status register A:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table C0001)
 7	=1 time update cycle in progress, data ouputs undefined 
	(bit 7 is read only)
 6-4	22 stage divider
	010 = 32768 Hz time base (default)
 3-0	rate selection bits for interrupt
	0000 none
	0011 122 microseconds (minimum)
	1111 500 milliseconds	
	0110 976.562 microseconds (default 1024 Hz)
Notes:	some operating systems seem to change the CMOS clock rate to slower
	  values for unknown purposes. Since on older ATs the clock rate does
	  not get restored after a cold boot, this may slow down disk
	  operations for example under PC DOS which depends on the clock rate.
	If IBMBIO.COM finds a model byte FCh (sub-models 00h, 01h, 02h, 03h,
	  or 06h) during init, it resets the clock rate to the default value
	  (00100110b).

Notes:	some operating systems seem to change the CMOS clock rate to slower
	  values for unknown purposes. Since on older ATs the clock rate does
	  not get restored after a cold boot, this may slow down disk
	  operations for example under PC DOS which depends on the clock rate.
	If IBMBIO.COM finds a model byte FCh (sub-models 00h, 01h, 02h, 03h,
	  or 06h) during init, it resets the clock rate to the default value
	  (00100110b).

----------R0E13------------------------------
CMOS 0Eh-13h - AMSTRAD - TIME AND DATE MACHINE LAST USED
----------R0F--------------------------------
CMOS 0Fh - IBM - RESET CODE (IBM PS/2 "Shutdown Status Byte")

(Table C0006)
Values for Reset Code / Shutdown Status Byte:
 00h-03h perform power-on reset
   00h	software reset or unexpected reset
   01h	reset after memory size check in real/virtual mode
	(or: chip set initialization for real mode reentry)
   02h	reset after successful memory test in real/virtual mode
   03h	reset after failed memory test in real/virtual mode
 04h	INT 19h reboot
 05h	flush keyboard (issue EOI) and jump via 40h:0067h
 06h	reset (after successful test in virtual mode)
	(or: jump via 40h:0067h without EOI)
 07h	reset (after failed test in virtual mode)
 08h	used by POST during protected-mode RAM test (return to POST)
 09h	used for INT 15/87h (block move) support
 0Ah	resume execution by jump via 40h:0067h
 0Bh	resume execution via IRET via 40h:0067h
 0Ch	resume execution via RETF via 40h:0067h
 0Dh-FFh perform power-on reset
--------!---Note-----------------------------

The second group of values extends from address 10h to 2Dh. The word at
2Eh-2Fh is a byte-wise summation of the values in these bytes. Most BIOSes
will generate a CMOS Checksum error if this value is invalid however many 
programs ignore the checksum and report the apparent value. The current
version of MSD reports my XT as having 20+ MB of extended memory. 

Where a definiton appears universal, no identification is made. Where
the definition is thought to be specific to a manufacturer/model (AMI, 
AMSTRAD, IBM AT, IBM PS/2) the identification is enclosed in parens. The
AMSTAD definitions appear to relate to 8088/8086 (PC and PC/XT class)
mchines only. AT class machines appear to adhere to IBM PC/AT fornat.
