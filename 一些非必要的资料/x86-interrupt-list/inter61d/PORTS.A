		XT, AT and PS/2	 I/O port addresses

Do NOT consider this information to be complete and accurate.  If you want
to do hardware programming ALWAYS check the appropriate data sheets (but
even they are sometimes in error!).  Be aware that erroneous port programming
can put your data or even your hardware at risk.

There are a number of memory-mapped addresses in use for I/O; see MEMORY.LST
for details on memory-mapped I/O.

--------!---Note-----------------------------
Note: the port description format is:

PPPPw RW  description

where:	PPPP	is the four-digit hex port number or a plus sign and three hex
		digits to indicate an offset from a base port address
	w	is blank for byte-size port, 'w' for word, and 'd' for dword
	R	is dash (or blank) if not readable, 'r' if sometimes readable,
		'R' if "always" readable, '?' if readability unknown
	W	is dash (or blank) if not writable, 'w' if sometimes writable,
		'W' if "always" writable, 'C' if write-clear, and
		'?' if writability unknown

  0	SMI# Gate (CSMIGATE)
	=0 (default) the SMI# signal is masked and negated

Note:	bit 0 only affects the SMI# signal and does not affect the

	  status bits in the SMIREQ Register). Thus, SMI conditions can be
	  pending when bit 0 is set to 1; if an SMI is already pending, the

PORT 0022-0024 - OPTi 82C493 System Controller (SYSC) - CONFIGURATION REGISTERS
Desc:	The OPTi 486SXWB contains three chips and is designed for systems
	  running at 20, 25 and 33MHz.	The chipset includes an 82C493 System
	  Controller (SYSC), the 82C392 Data Buffer Controller, and the
	  82C206 Integrated peripheral Controller (IPC).
Note:	every access to PORT 0024h must be preceded by a write to PORT 0022h,
	  even if the same register is being accessed a second time

	the counter chip is driven with a 1.193 MHz clock (1/4 of the
	original PC's 4.77 MHz CPU clock)
SeeAlso: PORT 0044h,PORT 0048h

0040  RW  PIT  counter 0, counter divisor	      (XT, AT, PS/2)
	Used to keep the system time; the default divisor of (1)0000h
	produces the 18.2Hz clock tick.
0041  RW  PIT  counter 1, RAM refresh counter	(XT, AT)
	don't set below 3 on PCs (default 12h), and don't mess with this
	counter at all unless you really know what you're doing....
0042  RW  PIT  counter 2, cassette & speaker	(XT, AT, PS/2)
	During normal operation mode (8253) 40h-42h set the counter values on
	write and get the current counter value on read. In 16bit modes two
	consequtive writes/reads must be issued, first with the low byte,
	followed by the high byte. In 8254 read back modes, all selected
	counters and status are latched and must be read out completely
	before normal operation is valid again.	 Each counter switches back
	to normal operation after read out.  In 'get status and counter'
	mode the first byte read is the status, followed by one or two
	counter values. (see #P0379)  Note that 16-bit reads performed
	without using the "latch" command will get the current high/low
	portion of the counter at the instant of the port read, so it is
	possible for the low part of the counter to wrap around before the
	high part gets read, resulting in a significant measurement error
0043  RW  PIT  mode port, control word register for counters 0-2 (see #P0380)
	Once a control word has been written (43h), it must be followed
	immediately by performing the corresponding action to the counter
	registers (40h-42h), else the system may hang!!
