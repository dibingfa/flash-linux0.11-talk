INT 51 - TI Professional PC - RESTART TIMING EVENT
	AX = timer count in 25ms intervals
	DS:DI -> timing-event table (see #03244)
Note:	documented as "for system use only"; intended for multi-tasking
	  software
SeeAlso: INT 50"TI Professional",INT 52"TI Professional"

Format of TI Professional PC timing event table:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 03244)
 00h	WORD	offset of next event table entry
 02h	BYTE	normally unused (FFh)
 03h	BYTE	flags:
		bit 7 set if timing event active
		bits 6-0 not used by BIOS (0), but could be used by option ROMs
 04h	WORD	timeout count (decremented every 25ms when active)
 06h	WORD	offset of event handler (in segment F400h) to call on event
		  timeout; the F400h segment allows addressing both system ROMs
		  and the first 16K of memory (due to the 1M memory wraparound)

INT 57 C - TI Professional PC - CRT MAPPING HOOK
	AX/BX/CX/DX/BP/SI/DI same as on entry to CRT subroutine (e.g. INT 49)
	DS = BIOS system segment
	ES = DE00h
Return: DF/IF flags must be preserved
	ES,DS,BP preserved
	AX,BX,CX,DX,SI,DI may be changed as necessary to modify the original
	  call
Desc:	hooking this vector permits programs to intercept or modify all
	  screen output, including both application calls to INT 49 and
	  calls generated internally by the BIOS which bypass INT 49
Note:	by default, this vector points at an IRET instruction

INT 58 C - TI Professional PC - SYSTEM TIMER 25ms HOOK
Desc:	called from the hardware timer tick interrupt, after executing the
	  first four BIOS timing events, updating the system clock, invoking
	  INT 5A if required, saving registers, and switching to a temporary
	  stack (the one reserved for IRQ3)
Notes:	the handler for this interrupt may destroy AX,BX,DI,ES but must
	  preserve all other registers; 8 WORDs of stack space are available,
	  of which at most 4 may be used if the handler enables interrupts
	if the handler switches stacks (because more than 4/8 WORDs are
	  required), the original stack must be restored before chaining to
	  the previous handler

INT 59 - TI Professional PC - COMMON ROM HARDWARE INTERRUPT EXIT VECTOR
Desc:	all hardware interrupts on the TI Pro jump indirectly to the handler
	  pointed at by this interrupt vector to finish their handling of
	  the hardware interrupt
Notes:	the default handler decrements the interrupt count, restores registers
	  (including the stack pointer), sends an EOI to the interrupt
	  controller, and finally does an IRET
	can be used by multitaskers which need to get control after every
	  hardware interrupt

	  first four BIOS timing events, updating the system clock, saving
	  registers, and switching to a temporary stack (the one reserved
	  for IRQ3), but before calling INT 58
	no details available
Notes:	this interrupt is invoked on every fourth timer interrupt
	the handler for this interrupt may destroy AX,BX,DI,ES but must
	  preserve all other registers; 8 WORDs of stack space are available,
	  of which at most 4 may be used if the handler enables interrupts
	if the handler switches stacks (because more than 4/8 WORDs are

INT 5B C - TI Professional PC - KEYBOARD MAPPING HOOK
	CF set
	AH = shift state (see #03247)
	AL = scan code (see #03214)
Return:	BX, CX, DI, ES may be destroyed
	various return methods are supported:
	    IRET, AX unchanged: process keystroke normally
	    IRET, AL = FFh: discard keystroke
	    IRET, AX changed: process modified keystroke
	    chain to old INT 5B: allow other handlers to look at (possibly
		  modified) keystroke in AX
	    RETF 2, CF clear: place returned AX into keyboard buffer without
		  any further processing
Notes:	invoked by the keyboard ISR, and used to remap the keyboard
	if CF is clear on entry, some other handler has processed the
	  keystroke and the current handler should not modify it, instead
	  performing a RETF 2 or IRET (after clearing CF on the stack)
	when requesting that a value be placed directly into the keyboard
	  buffer, AL and AH may not *both* be nonzero (the TI does not
	  return scan codes as part of the key code for non-extended keys)

INT 5C - NetBIOS INTERFACE
	ES:BX -> network control block (NCB) (see #03249)
Return: AL = status (see #03248)
Program: NetBIOS was developed by Sytek, Inc. in 1984 as a high-level
	  programming interface to the IBM PC Network; the first implementation
	  was a ROM BIOS extension on Sytek's PCnet LAN adapter card, but many
	  current networks support NetBIOS as the session layer.
Notes:	The Sytek PCnet card uses DMA 3.
	On some machines this vector is not initialized (e.g. Epson machines).
	  Hence this interrupt should only be called or hooked if the vector
	  does not point to 0000h:0000h.

Program: MDEBUG is a shareware memory-resident debugging tool by Bernd
	  Schemmer, including a memory monitor, an interpreter, and a
	  disassembler
Notes:	MDEBUG uses INT 60 by default, but may be directed to any of INT 60
	  through INT 67; the interrupt handler is preceded by the signature
	  "USERINT" and is not chained
	if DS:SI points at a null byte, MDEBUG will prompt for a password if
	  passwords are active; enough stack space must be provided for an
	  INT 10h call (which MDEBUG uses while prompting for the password)

Notes:	This service is handled by the adapter driver
	The request dispatch table contains dummy entries for subfunctions

	  (invalid operation) in the request block's result buffer
	This interface does the same as the corresponding AX=0001h interface,
	  but with a slightly modified request block structure (i.e it allows
	  FAR parameter block pointers) and without expecting DS=0001h
	Some adapter drivers (e.g. the NDIS2 token ring driver NDTOKBAN for
	  VINES 5.53) ignore the value in CX and use the value from DX instead
