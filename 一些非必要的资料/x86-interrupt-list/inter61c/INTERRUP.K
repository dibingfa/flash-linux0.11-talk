Interrupt List, part 11 of 18
Copyright (c) 1989-1999,2000 Ralf Brown
--------D-26---------------------------------
INT 26 - DOS 1+ - ABSOLUTE DISK WRITE (except partitions > 32M)
	AL = drive number (00h = A:, 01h = B:, etc)
	CX = number of sectors to write (not FFFFh)
	DX = starting logical sector number (0000h - highest sector on drive)
	DS:BX -> data to write
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AH = status (see #02547)
	    AL = error code (same as passed to INT 24 in DI)
	    AX = 0207h if more than 64K sectors on drive -- use new-style call
	may destroy all other registers except segment registers
Notes:	original flags are left on stack, and must be popped by caller
	this call bypasses the DOS filesystem, though DOS 5+ invalidates any
	  disk buffers referencing sectors which are written with this call
	examination of CPWIN386.CPL indicates that if this call fails with
	  error 0408h on an old-style (<32M) call, one should retry the
	  call with the high bit of the drive number in AL set
	Novell DOS 7 decides whether the old-style or new-style (>32M) version
	  of INT 26 must be used solely on the basis of the partition's size,
	  thus forcing use of the new-style call even for data in the first
	  32M of the partition
	Windows98 will display an error message and deliberately hang the
	  system on attempted write to any hard disk if neither bit 7 of the
	  Extended Drive Info byte nor bit 6 of "DOS_FLAG" (List-of-Lists+60h)
	  is set
	Although all registers except segment registers may be destroyed
	 some software depends on some of the registers being preserved.
	 For example some Flash disk drivers requires that DX is not trashed.
	 DR-DOS 7.03 takes care of this.
BUGS:	DOS 3.1 through 3.3 set the word at ES:[BP+1Eh] to FFFFh if AL is an
	  invalid drive number
	DR DOS 3.41 will return with a jump instead of RETF, leaving the
	  wrong number of bytes on the stack; use the huge-partition version
	  (INT 26/CX=FFFFh) for all partition sizes under DR DOS 3.41
	DR DOS 6.0 original releases 05/1991 & 08/1991 reported wrong error
	  codes for "drive not ready" and "write protect". This was fixed
	  with the DR DOS BDOS patch "PAT321" (1992/02/19, XDIR /C: 947Bh)
	  and later "full" rebuilds (see INT21/AX=4452h for details).

--------D-26----CXFFFF-----------------------
INT 26 - DOS 3.31+ - ABSOLUTE DISK WRITE (32M-2047M hard-disk partition)
	CX = FFFFh
	AL = drive number (0=A, 1=B, etc)
	DS:BX -> disk write packet (see #02552)
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AH = status (see #02547)
	    AL = error code (same as passed to INT 24 in DI)
	may destroy all other registers except segment registers
Notes:	partition is potentially >32M (and requires this form of the call) if
	  bit 1 of the device attribute word in the device driver is set
	original flags are left on stack, and must be removed by caller
	this call bypasses the DOS filesystem, though DOS 5+ invalidates any
	  disk buffers referencing sectors which are written with this call
	for FAT32 drives (which may be up to 2TB in size), use INT 21/AX=7305h
	Windows98 will display an error message and deliberately hang the
	  system on attempted write to any hard disk if neither bit 7 of the
	  Extended Drive Info byte nor bit 6 of "DOS_FLAG" (List-of-Lists+60h)
	  is set
SeeAlso: INT 13/AH=03h,INT 25/CX=FFFFh,INT 26,INT 21/AX=7305h

Format of disk write packet:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 02552)
 00h	DWORD	sector number
 04h	WORD	number of sectors to read
 06h	DWORD	transfer address
SeeAlso: #02548
--------G-26---------------------------------
INT 26 - COMTROL HOSTESS i/ISA DEBUGGER - ENTER/EXIT EXTENDED ADDRESSING MODE
	???
Return: ???
SeeAlso: INT 23"COMTROL",INT 27"COMTROL"
--------D-27---------------------------------
INT 27 - DOS 1+ - TERMINATE AND STAY RESIDENT
	DX = number of bytes to keep resident (max FFF0h)
	CS = segment of PSP
Return: never
Notes:	this is an obsolete call
	INT 22, INT 23, and INT 24 are restored from the PSP
	does not close any open files
	the minimum number of bytes which will remain resident is 110h for
	  DOS 2.x and 60h for DOS 3.0+; there is no minimum for DOS 1.x, which
	  implements this service in COMMAND.COM rather than the DOS kernel
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=31h
--------G-27---------------------------------
INT 27 - COMTROL HOSTESS i/ISA DEBUGGER - INVOKE REMOTE TURBO DEBUGGER KERNEL
	???
Return: ???
Desc:	invoke a copy of the remote Turbo Debugger kernel on the Hostess i
	  controller
SeeAlso: INT 20"COMTROL",INT 26"COMTROL"
--------D-28---------------------------------
INT 28 C - DOS 2+ - DOS IDLE INTERRUPT
	SS:SP = top of MS-DOS stack for I/O functions
Return: all registers preserved
Desc:	This interrupt is invoked each time one of the DOS character input
	  functions loops while waiting for input.  Since a DOS call is in
	  progress even though DOS is actually idle during such input waits,
	  hooking this function is necessary to allow a TSR to perform DOS
	  calls while the foreground program is waiting for user input.	 The
	  INT 28h handler may invoke any INT 21h function except functions
	  00h through 0Ch.
Notes:	under DOS 2.x, the critical error flag (the byte immediately after the
	  InDOS flag) must be set in order to call DOS functions 50h/51h from
	  the INT 28h handler without destroying the DOS stacks.
	calls to INT 21/AH=3Fh,40h from within an INT 28 handler may not use a
	  handle which refers to CON
	at the time of the call, the InDOS flag (see INT 21/AH=34h) is normally
	  set to 01h; if larger, DOS is truly busy and should not be reentered
	the default handler is an IRET instruction
	supported in OS/2 compatibility box
	the _MS-DOS_Programmer's_Reference_ for DOS 5.0 incorrectly documents
	  this interrupt as superseded
	the performance of NetWare Lite servers (and probably other peer-to-
	  peer networks) can be dramatically improved by calling INT 28
	  frequently from an application's idle loop
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=34h,INT 2A/AH=84h,INT 2F/AX=1680h
--------U-289999-----------------------------
INT 28 u - PCXDUMP v9.00+ - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 9999h
Return: AX = AAAAh if installed
	    CX = version number * 100 (example: 03A2h = 930 = v9.30)
	    DL = interrupt used by the dump function (see #02553)
		(00h if call not available)
	    BX = CS of PCXDUMP's INT 28 handler (undocumented)
	    ES = segment of PCXDUMP's memory block (v9.30, undocumented)
Program: PCXDUMP is a shareware screen grabber saving in PCX format
Notes:	if DL<>00h a dump can be requested by calling INT DL as shown
	  below (the user can choose the interrupt number at installation
	  time); if DL=00h the dump function can be called only by hotkeys
	  (this is the default)

(Table 02553)
Call PCXDUMP screen-dump function with:
	INT xx
	AX = 1234h
	BX = dump type
	    0000h Color dump
	    0001h Immediate color dump
	    0002h Black/White dump
	    0003h Immediate B/W dump
	    0004h Inverted B/W dump
	    0005h Gray scaled dump
	    0006h Inverted gray scaled dump
	    0007h Text screen dump to text file
	    0008h Text screen dump to ansi file
Return: nothing
Notes:	if BX=0001h, 0003h, 0007h or 0008h the whole screen will be
	  dumped; the other valid values will draw a selection frame
	  on the screen except in text modes (text modes allow only
	  full screen dumps)
	this function doesn't perform the dump, it only requests it;
	  the dump will be performed after a few milliseconds if it's
	  safe to do so, thus the author recommends putting a 60 ms delay
	  after this call
--------D-29---------------------------------
INT 29 C - DOS 2+ - FAST CONSOLE OUTPUT
	AL = character to display
Return: nothing
	BX may be destroyed by some versions of DOS 3.3
Notes:	automatically called when writing to a device with bit 4 of its device
	  driver header set (see also INT 21/AH=52h)
	COMMAND.COM v3.2 and v3.3 compare the INT 29 vector against the INT 20
	  vector and assume that ANSI.SYS is installed if the segment is larger
	the default handler under DOS 2.x and 3.x simply calls INT 10/AH=0Eh
	the default handler under DESQview 2.2 understands the <Esc>[2J
	  screen-clearing sequence, calls INT 10/AH=0Eh for all others
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=52h,INT 2F/AX=0802h,INT 79"AVATAR.SYS"

INT 2A - NETWORK - CHECK DIRECT I/O
	AX = 0300h
	DS:SI -> ASCIZ device name (may be full path or only drive specifier--
		  must include the colon)
Return: CF clear if direct physical addressing (INT 13,INT 25) permissible
	CF set if access via files only
Notes:	do not use direct disk accesses if this function returns CF set or the
	  device is redirected (INT 21/AX=5F02h)
	use AH=00h to determine whether the network is installed; if not,
	  direct physical access is allowed
	may take some time to execute, so programs which need to check
	  frequently should save the result of the first call

Notes:	invokes either INT 5B or INT 5C as appropriate
	supported by PC LAN Program, LANtastic, LAN Manager, NetWare, 10NET,
	  etc.
	NetWare 2.15 NetBIOS emulator returns CF clear if successful, CF set
	  on error
	PC LAN Program defines any non-zero return value in AH as an error
	  indicator for subfunction 00h, and any non-zero return value in AX
	  as an error indicator for subfunction 01h

INT 2A - NETWORK - PC LAN PROG v1.31+ - GET LOGGED ON USER NAME
	AX = 7802h
	ES:DI -> 8-byte buffer to be filled
Return: AL = 00h if no user logged on to Extended Services
	AL <> 00h if user logged on to Extended Services
	    buffer at ES:DI filled with name, padded to 8 chars with blanks.
--------D-2A80-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - BEGIN DOS CRITICAL SECTION
	AH = 80h
	AL = critical section number (00h-0Fh) (see #02555)
Notes:	normally hooked to avoid interrupting a critical section, rather than
	  called
	the handler should ensure that none of the critical sections are
	  reentered, usually by suspending a task which attempts to reenter
	  an active critical section
	the DOS kernel does not invoke critical sections 01h and 02h unless it
	  is patched.  DOS 3.1+ contains a zero-terminated list of words
	  beginning at offset -11 from the Swappable Data Area
	  (see #01687 at INT 21/AX=5D06h); each word contains the offset within
	  the DOS data segment of a byte which must be changed from C3h (RET)
	  to 50h (PUSH AX) under DOS 3.x or from 00h to a nonzero value under
	  DOS 4.0+ to enable use of critical sections.	For DOS 4.0+, all
	  words in this list point at the byte at offset 0D0Ch.
	MS Windows patches the DOS kernel's calls to INT 2A/AH=80h-81h into
	  far calls to its own handler, and does not reflect the calls back
	  to INT 2A unless SYSTEM.INI contains ReflectDOSInt2A=1 or
	  ModifyDOSInt2A=0 in the [386Enh] section
	Novell NETX does not issue INT 2A/AH=80h and INT 2A/AH=81h calls when
	  it intercepts INT 21 calls and processes them itself
SeeAlso: AH=81h,AH=82h,AX=8700h,INT 21/AX=5D06h,INT 21/AX=5D0Bh

(Table 02555)
Values for DOS critical section number:
 01h	DOS kernel, SHARE.EXE, DOSMGR
	apparently for maintaining the integrity of DOS/SHARE/NET
	  data structures
 02h	DOS kernel, DOSMGR
	ensures that no multitasking occurs while DOS is calling an
	  installable device driver
 05h	network redirector
 06h	DOS 4.x only IFSFUNC
 08h	ASSIGN.COM
 0Ah	MSCDEX, CORELCDX
 0Fh	IBM PC LAN server (while intercepting INT 10/AH=06h,07h,0Eh)
--------D-2A81-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - END DOS CRITICAL SECTION
	AH = 81h
	AL = critical section number (00h-0Fh) (see #02555)
Notes:	normally hooked rather than called
	the handler should reawaken any tasks which were suspended due to an
	  attempt to enter the specified critical section
	MS Windows patches the DOS kernel's calls to INT 2A/AH=80h-81h into
	  far calls to its own handler, and does not reflect the calls back
	  to INT 2A unless SYSTEM.INI contains ReflectDOSInt2A=1 or
	  ModifyDOSInt2A=0 in the [386Enh] section
SeeAlso: AH=80h,AH=82h,AX=8700h
--------D-2A82-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - END DOS CRITICAL SECTIONS 0 THROUGH 7
	AH = 82h
Notes:	called by the INT 21h function dispatcher for function 0 and functions
	  greater than 0Ch except 59h, and on process termination
	the handler should reawaken any tasks which were suspended due to an
	  attempt to enter one of the critical sections 0 through 7
SeeAlso: AH=81h
--------N-2A84-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - KEYBOARD BUSY LOOP
	AH = 84h
Notes:	similar to DOS's INT 28h, called from inside the DOS keyboard input
	  loop (i.e. INT 21/AH=07h or INT 21/AH=08h) to allow the network
	  software to process requests
	Novell DOS 7+ calls this function with AX=8400h from inside of
	  the keyboard input loop.

--------N-2A86-------------------------------
INT 2A U - PC Network v1.00 - RECEIVER.COM - ???

--------P-2A8700-----------------------------
INT 2A CU - PRINT - BEGIN BACKGROUND PRINTING
	AX = 8700h
	CF clear
Return: CF clear if OK to print in background now
	CF set if background printing not allowed at this time
Desc:	used to inform interested programs that PRINT is about to start its
	  background processing, and allow those programs to postpone the
	  processing if necessary
Notes:	when PRINT gains control and wants to begin printing, it calls this
	  function.  If CF is clear on return, PRINT begins its background
	  processing, and calls AX=8701h when it is done.  If CF is set on
	  return, PRINT will relinquish control immediately, and will not
	  call AX=8701h
	PCVENUS (an early network shell by IBM and CMU) hooks this call to
	  prevent background printing while its own code is active
SeeAlso: AH=80h,AH=81h,AX=8701h
--------P-2A8701-----------------------------
INT 2A CU - PRINT - END BACKGROUND PRINTING
	AX = 8701h
Desc:	used to inform interested programs that PRINT has completed its
	  background processing
Note:	called by PRINT after it has performed some background printing; not
	  called if AX=8700h returned with CF set.
SeeAlso: AX=8700h

INT 2C R - Cloaking - CALL PROTECTED-MODE PASSALONG CHAIN
Notes:	when this interrupt is invoked in V86 mode, RM386 will invoke the first
	  in a chain of protected-mode handlers, and will only pass execution
	  to the V86-mode INT 2C handler if none of the handlers in the
	  passalong chain handle the call instead.  This is the method by which
	  the real-mode stub of a cloaked application communicates with the
	  protected-mode portion.
	the cloaking host calls the passalong chain with EAX=58494E33h ('WIN3')
	  when MS Windows starts up and with EAX=334E4958h ('3NIW') when
	  Windows shuts down; between these two broadcasts, the additional

INT 2D - ALTERNATE MULTIPLEX INTERRUPT SPECIFICATION (AMIS) [v3.6]
	AH = multiplex number
	AL = function
	    00h installation check
	    01h get private entry point
	    02h uninstall
	    03h request popup
	    04h determine chained interrupts
	    05h get hotkey list
	    06h get device-driver information
	    07h-0Fh reserved for future enhancements
		Return: AL = 00h (not implemented)
	    other  application-dependent
	other registers vary by function (also see individual entries below)
Return: varies by function
Notes:	programs should not use fixed multiplex numbers; rather, a program
	  should scan all multiplex numbers from 00h to FFh, remembering the
	  first unused multiplex in case the program is not yet installed.
	  For multiplex numbers which are in use, the program should compare
	  the first 16 bytes of the signature string to determine whether it
	  is already installed on that multiplex number.  If not previously
	  installed, it should use the first free multiplex number.
	functions other than 00h are not valid unless a program is installed
	  on the selected multiplex number
	to be considered fully compliant with version 3.6 of the specification,
	  programs must implement at least functions 00h, 02h (no resident
	  uninstall code required), and 04h (return value 04h).	 TSRs that
	  provide hotkeys with which the user can activate them must also
	  implement function 05h.  TSRs which provide DOS device drivers must
	  also implement function 06h.	The absolute minimum fully-compliant
	  implementation has an overhead of 64 bytes (80 bytes with function
	  05h) plus 22 bytes per hooked interrupt (for the interrupt sharing
	  protocol header and hook list entry).
	the signature string and description may be used by memory mappers
	  to display the installed programs
	to be considered fully compliant, users of this specification must
	  adhere to the IBM interrupt sharing protocol (see #02568), which will
	  permit removal of TSRs in arbitrary order and interrupt handler
	  reordering.  All TSRs following this specification should be
	  removable unless they are loaded from CONFIG.SYS, though they need
	  not keep the code for removing themselves resident; it is acceptable
	  for a separate program to perform the interrupt unhooking and
	  memory-freeing steps of removal.
	A sample public-domain implementation including example TSRs and
	  utility programs may be found in a separate package distributed as
	  AMISLnnn.ZIP (AMISL092.ZIP as of this writing).
	Please let me know if you choose to follow this proposal.  The
	  signature and a list of the private API calls you use would be
	  appreciated, as well.

Format of interrupt sharing protocol interrupt handler entry point:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 02568)
 00h  2 BYTEs	short jump to actual start of interrupt handler, immediately
		  following this data block (EBh 10h)
 02h	DWORD	address of next handler in chain
 06h	WORD	signature 424Bh
 08h	BYTE	EOI flag
		00h software interrupt or secondary hardware interrupt handler
		80h primary hardware interrupt handler (will issue EOI to

 09h  2 BYTEs	short jump to hardware reset routine
		must point at a valid FAR procedure (may be just RETF)
 0Bh  7 BYTEs	reserved (0) by IBM for future expansion
Note:	when chaining to the prior handler, the interrupt handler must perform
	  an indirect jump/call using the address at offset 02h in the
	  ISP header.  This permits another AMIS TSR to hook itself into
	  the chain at a position other than as the first handler to receive
	  an interrupt.

Notes:	except for bit 7, the shift states correspond exactly to the return
	  values from INT 16/AH=12h.  A set bit in the required states word
	  indicates that the corresponding shift state must be active when the
	  hotkey's scan code is received for the hotkey to be recognized; a
	  clear bit means that the corresponding state may be ignored.	A set
	  bit in the disallowed shift states word indicates that the

	for the disallowed-states word, if one of the "either" bits is set,
	  then both the corresponding left bit and right bit must be set

Notes:	this call allows execution of arbitrary commands (including COMMAND.COM

	if COMMAND.COM is the user's command interpreter, the primary copy
	  executes the command; this allows the master environment to be
	  modified by issuing a "SET" command, but changes in the master
	  environment will not become effective until all programs descended
	  from the primary COMMAND.COM terminate
	since COMMAND.COM processes the string as if typed from the keyboard,
	  the transient portion needs to be present, and the calling program
	  must ensure that sufficient memory to load the transient portion can
	  be allocated by DOS if necessary
	results are unpredictable if invoked by a program run from a batch file
	  because this call is not reentrant and COMMAND.COM uses the same
	  internal variables when processing a batch file
	hooked but ignored by 4DOS v3.0 COMMAND.COM replacement unless SHELL2E

INT 2F - Multiplex - NOTES
	AH = identifier of program which is to handle the interrupt
	   00h-3Fh reserved for IBM (for DOS)
	   40h-7Fh reserved for Microsoft (for DOS)
	   80h-B7h reserved for IBM
	   B8h-BFh reserved for networks
	   C0h-FFh reserved for applications
	AL is the function code
   This is a general mechanism for verifying the presence of a TSR and
   communicating with it.  When searching for a free identifier code for AH
   using the installation check (AL=00h), the calling program should set
   BX/CX/DX to 0000h and must not depend on any registers other than CS:IP
   and SS:SP to be valid on return, since numerous programs now use additional
   registers on input and/or output for the installation check.
Notes:	Since the multiplex chain is growing so long, and beginning to
	  experience multiplex number collisions, I have proposed an alternate
	  multiplex interrupt on INT 2D.  If you decide to use the alternate
	  multiplex, please let me know.
	DOS and some other programs return values in the flags register, so
	  any TSR which chains by calling the previous handler rather than
	  jumping to it should ensure that the returned flags are preserved
	  and passed back to the original caller

INT 2F - SHARE - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 1000h
Return: AL = status
	    00h not installed, OK to install
	    01h not installed, not OK to install
	    FFh installed
Notes:	supported by OS/2 v1.3+ compatibility box, which always returns AL=FFh
	if DOS 4.01 SHARE was automatically loaded, file sharing is in an
	  inactive state (due to the undocumented /NC flag used by the autoload
	  code) until this call is made
	DR DOS 5.0 SHARE 1.00 only checks for AH=10h and in this case does not
	  chain to a previous handler, DR DOS 6.0 SHARE 1.02+ properly chains
	  for any values other than AX=1000h and the private FDOS hook
	  AX=1001h.  However, under DR PalmDOS and Novell DOS 7+, the
	  SHARE 2.00+ only tests for the AX=1000h install check, since it no
	  longer uses AX=1001h to hook into the system.
	DOS 5+ chains to the previous handler if AL <> 00h on entry
	Windows Enhanced mode hooks this call and reports that SHARE is
	  installed even when it is not
BUGS:	values of AL other than 00h put DOS 3.x SHARE into an infinite loop
	  (08E9: OR  AL,AL
	   08EB: JNZ 08EB) <- the buggy instruction (DOS 3.3)

INT 2F U - DR DOS 6.0+ FDOS EXTENSIONS - INSTALL FDOS HOOK (SHARE / DELWATCH)
	AX = 1001h
	DX:BX -> new FDOS stub entry function
Return: nothing
Notes:	the default handler for the pointer set by this call under DELWATCH
	  simply returns with CF set
	In Digital Research terminology FDOS is the part of the BDOS kernel
	  (IBMDOS.COM) responsible for the file system and related tasks, and
	  its functionality is also used by the BDOS kernel itself. However,
	  for reasons of performance and code size, it uses direct calling.
	This interrupt allows external components like SHARE file locking or
	  DELWATCH delete tracking software to hook into the internal backdoor
	  INT 2F/AH=10h/AL<=09h chain in the kernel, so that they can actually
	  allows the kernel to ensure that several conditions are met when
	  passing control to these registered components including proper
	  maintaining A20, re-enterancy, or critical section mutexing
	  (e.g. getting the disk sub-system queue "MXdisk").
	The default handler in the BDOS just sets the carry flag and returns.
	Currently known clients to this shared interface are DR DOS 6.0
	  SHARE 1.xx, DR DOS 6.0+ DELWATCH 1.00+, which both chain onto
	  the same call far address, and the version of AddStor's SuperStor
	  which is bundled with DR DOS 6.0
	However, the DR PalmDOS, and Novell DOS 7 - DR-DOS 7.03 SHARE 2.00-2.05
	  do not use this function to hook into the system. Instead they fix up
	  the share stubs directly. DR PalmDOS SHARE 2.00 uses the stubs at
	  Table !!! INT 21/AH=52h, while Novell DOS 7 - DR-DOS 7.03
	  SHARE 2.01-2.05 use the private set of share stubs at Table !!! at
	  INT 21/AX=4458h).  Future releases may possibly again fix up the
	  share stubs at INT 21/AH=52h.

Return: DS destroyed???
Notes:	Sets a pointer in the kernel. ES:BX points to a structure in SHARE's
	  segment, which presumeably contains a number (4 or 11???) of entries
	  of 5 bytes each and is probably part of some kind of share stub
	  dispatcher that gets fixed up by this call.
	This was seen called by DR DOS 5.0 SHARE 1.00 (when INT 2F/AX=1000h
	  revealed that SHARE was not installed) before it hooked INT 2Fh
	  via INT 21/AH=35h to provide its install check function. It preserved
	  the DS register before calling.
	However, the DR DOS 6.0+ SHARE 1.02+ uses INT 2F/AX=1001h to hook
	  into the OS, DR PalmDOS SHARE 2.00 directly fixes up the share stubs
	  in table !!! at INT 21h/52h, and Novell DOS 7 - DR-DOS 7.03

Notes:	This function is known to be supported by Paragon Technology Systems
	  PTS-DOS 6.51 and S/DOS 1.0, and probably was also supported
	  in earlier releases.  It is handled from within the kernel's
	  INT 2Fh dispatcher.
	Resident system extensions should call INT 2Fh/12F0h to intercept
	  the INT 2Fh chain. The main idea of this call is to allow them to
	  be moved to the HMA and intercept INT 2Fh without querying A20 state
	  and without interception of the INT2Fh vector. This is why the
	  "Chain2F" variable must be instanced by placing it to the SDA.
	On chain entry of the far procedure, CF must be set.  All registers
	  except for AX, BP, and DS remain unchanged. If a handler cannot
	  process the call, it must set CF and do a far jump to the previous
	  one in the chain in order to indicate an error.  If CF is still set
	  on exit, the call will be ignored.

Notes:	called by Novell DOS 7 TaskMgr
	if this function returns with AX=0000h, then the code necessary to

	  available for use
	because the request is handled on the initial trap to the memory
	  manager caused by INT instructions, this function must be invoked
	  with an actual INT 2F instruction instead of some simulation such
	  as a far call to the address in the interrupt vector table

INT 2F U - DOS 3.2+ - SET DISK INTERRUPT HANDLER
	AH = 13h
	DS:DX -> interrupt handler disk driver calls on read/write
	ES:BX = address to restore INT 13 to on system halt (exit from root
		 shell) or warm boot (INT 19)
Return: DS:DX set by previous invocation of this function
	ES:BX set by previous invocation of this function
Notes:	IO.SYS hooks INT 13 and inserts one or more filters ahead of the
	  original INT 13 handler.  The first is for disk change detection
	  on floppy drives, the second is for tracking formatting calls and
	  correcting DMA boundary errors, the third is for working around
	  problems in a particular version of IBM's ROM BIOS
	before the first call, ES:BX points at the original BIOS INT 13; DS:DX
	  also points there unless IO.SYS has installed a special filter for
	  hard disk reads (on systems with model byte FCh and BIOS date
	  "01/10/84" only), in which case it points at the special filter
	most DOS 3.2+ disk access is via the vector in DS:DX, although a few
	  functions are still invoked via an INT 13 instruction
	during Windows 3.1 startup this function seems to be used to
	  temporarily point DOS to a dummy handler in WDCTRL.386 which always
	  halts the system with a fatal error message.	If DS hasn't changed
	  on return from the function, Windows will display the error message
	  "Invalid DOS version".
	this is a dangerous security loophole for any virus-monitoring software
	  which does not trap this call ("INT13", "Nomenklatura", and many
	  Bulgarian viruses are known to use it to get the original ROM entry
	  point)
	the preloadable Novell DOS 7+ SECURITY.BIN driver $SECURE$ traps
	  this call.
BUG:	Novell DOS 7 IBMBIO.COM before 1995-05-08 trashed AX on return from
	  this function. VGACOPY by Thomas Mnkemeier's VGA Software GmbH
	  crashed due to this.	Later releases of Novell DOS 7 preserved the
	  contents of the AX register.

Program: NLSFUNC 4.01+ is currently an independent project under
	  development by Matthias Paul. It is not yet publically available,
	  but as NLSFUNC 4.00 did, it will probably become available with
	  future DR-DOS releases.
Notes:	If BX <> 0EDCh on entry, DR-DOS NLSFUNC 4.01+ performs the standard
	  installation check (INT 2F/AX=1400h), and does not change ES:DI.
	DR DOS 5.0+ NLSFUNC 3.00+ returns CF set and AX=0001h, if AL was not
	  00h, FEh, or FFh on entry.
	NLSFUNC 4.01+ will use the ES:DI enhancement to check the driver
	  version and calculate displacements into the resident driver for
	  runtime updates of internal structures like the local NLS database
	  filespec, etc.
	If the returned ES points into the HMA (ES=FFFEh) care should be taken
	  to actually access the HMA while checking the version signature and
	  updating resident data (mutex with local A20 enable/disable).
	While previous issues of NLSFUNC installed under a multitasker,
	  DR-DOS NLSFUNC 4.01+ will actually adapt to work properly in this
	  environment.

INT 2F - CD-ROM v2.10+ - SEND DEVICE DRIVER REQUEST
	AX = 1510h
	CX = CD-ROM drive letter (0 = A, 1 = B, etc)
	ES:BX -> CD-ROM device driver request header (see #02597 at AX=0802h)
Return: CF clear if device driver has been called (check the request header's
	      status word to determine whether an error has occurred)
	    ES:BX request header updated
	CF set if device driver has not been called
	    AX = error code (000Fh = invalid drive, 0001h = invalid function)
	    ES:BX request header unchanged
Notes:	MSCDEX initializes the device driver request header's subunit field
	  based on the drive number specified in CX
	MSCDEX v2.21 through v2.25 (at least) return error code AX=0001h if
	  nested calls are attempted
BUGS:	Novell DOS 7 NWCDEX prior to the 12/13/94 update did not initialize
	  the subunit field
	Windows95 sets CF if CX isn't a CD-ROM drive but leaves CF unchanged
	  if the drive is in fact a CD-ROM

INT 2F - CD-ROM - CORELCDX - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 15FFh
	BX = 0000h
Return: BX = ABCDh if CORELCDX loaded
Note:	Corel's CORELCDX.COM is a replacement for MSCDEX.EXE; it also supports
	  the standard MSCDEX installation check calls AX=1500h and AX=150Ch
