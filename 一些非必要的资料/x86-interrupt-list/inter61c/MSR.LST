--------!---Note-----------------------------
Note:	except where mentioned otherwise, Pentium information also applies to
	  the PentiumMMX; Pentium Pro information also applies to the
	  Pentium II; and AMD K6 information also applies to the K6-2 and
	  K6-III
----------S00000000--------------------------
MSR 00000000h - Pentium, Pentium Pro - MACHINE CHECK EXCEPTION ADDRESS
Size:	32-36 bits
Access:	Read
Desc:	on any Machine Check exception (INT 12), this MSR contains the physical
	  address at which the exception occurred
Notes:	also supported by AMD Am5k86, K5, and K6; however, the K6 does not
	  actually support the machine check -- this register may be written
	  on the K6 to emulate that functionality
	this register does not exist on the Pentium Pro/Pentium II, but will
	  not cause an exception when accessed
SeeAlso: MSR 00000001h,MSR 80000000h,INT 12"MACHINE CHECK"
----------S00000001--------------------------

Desc:	when a Machine Check exception occurs, this register contains the
