INT 2F - Novell NetWare - Adv NetWare 4.0 DOS Requester - GET VLM CALL ADDRESS
	AX = 7A20h
	BX = 0000h
Return: AX = 0000h on success (installed)
	    ES:BX -> far call address for DOS Requester (see #02859)
Notes:	the DOS Requester replaces the NetWare Shell (ANETx, NETx) on
	  NetWare LAN's as of the release of Advanced NetWare 4.0 (1993).  It
	  is backward compatible with NetWare 2.1x through 3.11 servers as
	  well.	 Note that there was a NetWare 4.0 in the early 1980's, which
	  can cause confusion.
	this call is used as the installation check by VLM.EXE, which is the
	  loader for all the modules of the DOS Requester
	.VLMs are standard old .EXE format executables whose normal entry point
	  merely terminates to prevent loading from the command line (Novell's
	  VLMs all return errorlevel 6).  The real entry point is found by
	  looking at the VLM header at the beginning of the load image
	  (see #02862)
Index:	installation check;NetWare 4.0 DOS Requester

	STACK:	WORD	destination function
		WORD	destination VLM ID (see #02861)

Return: AX = status code (0000h,8811h,8846h,8848h,8853h) (see #02860)
	ZF set if successful, clear on error
	other registers as appropriate for function
	STACK popped

	  initialized this way to receive a fontpage 0 if ARABIC.COM/

	  support. At least this is what CODEPAGE.COM assumes (by using

BUG:	Novell DOS 7.0's COMMAND.COM (prior to Update 12) will attempt to run
	  a disk program with the indicated name even if the returned length

	  clobbered without first checking it.	The workaround is to set the

	  the original command's length, which will also work with MS-DOS 6.

Note:	if the next INT 21h call (and ONLY the next) is function 3Dh, 43h, or
	  6Ch (also 4B03h and 4Eh if /X active), the fully qualified filename
	  is written over top of the filename passed to the INT 21h call.  The
	  application must provide a sufficiently large buffer.	 This state is
	  reset after the next INT 21h call processed by APPEND.
	APPEND uses the byte at offset 3Dh in the PSP
	  (see #01378 at INT 21/AH=26h) to store the flag telling it to
	  overwrite the filename

Notes:	this function is supported by PC LAN Program, LAN Manager, LANtastic,

	LANtastic and NetWare Lite use only BL for the return value, preserving
