This is the fifth of six archives containing the x/86MS-DOS Interrupt List,
Release 61.

This archive contains utility programs and viewers for the interrupt
list.  Most of these programs have been contributed by others; if you
have problems with a contributed program, please contact the author of
the program with which you experienced difficulties.

The DOS viewers Interrupt Helper, Interrupt Summary, and IVIEW are
offered in this archive, as is the Windows viewer ILINA.  Interrupt
Summary is designed to be keystroke-compatible with INTERVUE (which is
no longer included), while offering additional functionality.  IVIEW is
designed to conserve disk space by not requiring any additional index
files and by itself being as compact as possible (under 2K!).

In addition, the source code for COMBINE, INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the
Epsilon extension code I use while editing the list are included in
this archive.
