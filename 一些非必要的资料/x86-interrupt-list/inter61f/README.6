This is the sixth of six archives containing the x86/MS-DOS Interrupt List,
Release 61.

This archive contains programs to convert the MS-DOS interrupt list
into hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help
systems.  These programs have been contributed by others; I have not
tested most of them personally because I do not own the help systems
for which they produce databases.  If you have problems, please contact
the author of the program with which you experienced difficulties.
Some of these programs predate, and will thus not take advantage of,
recent enhancements to the list's format.  MOST OF THESE CONVERSION
UTILITIES ARE NOT STAND-ALONE PRODUCTS!  You must have the appropriate
help system compiler to create an actual hypertext database which can
be read by the help system; these are not included because they are
commercial products, usually distributed together with the hypertext
viewer.

Not included here because it is rather large and is distributed
separately by the author, is IL2HDK by Ron Loewy, a conversion program
to put the interrupt list into Help Development Kit format, from which
it can be converted into about a dozen different formats, including
WinHelp, QuickHelp, Borland THELP, OS/2 IPF, POPHELP, and DESQview/X
help. At the time of this writing, the current freeware version was 3.5
(IL2HDK35), with v4.3 included in the commercial version of HLPDK
(see http://www.hyperact.com/hact8.html).

[NOTE: due to the change in table numbering introduced with Release 59,
some or all of the following programs may fail to properly cross-reference
tables.]
